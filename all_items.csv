Ahead of the Chinese Communist Party’s highly important 20th National Congress to be held in the late autumn of 2022, the eyes of the global Intelligence Community are turning to Beijing. How to divine what exactly is going on in the black box of Chinese elite politics at this sensitive moment? This is the million-dollar-question facing analysts of Chinese politics. We argue that there is a gap asking to be bridged between the “art” and “science” of reading Chinese elite politics, or between on the one hand, the traditional Beijingology, and on the other hand, purely academically relevant research. There is a pressing need for a “Beijingology 2.0,” combining the traditional art of the China hands with the most innovative methods and tools derived from social science research into elite studies and text analysis, respectively.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/57TYKUL7,2023-07-03,"Bjørnar Sverdrup-Thygeson, Stig Stenslie",,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2024-01-26T17:28:29Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

Russia also prizes support for its side in the war in Ukraine. The Ukraine war is key to the identification and recruitment of Western extremist groups by Russia. Russian assistance consists of providing propaganda support, finances, weapons, and paramilitary training. Russia likely does this to undermine the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union (EU), and other nations they perceive as moving toward NATO and the EU. Russian support enhances a group’s effectiveness even if extremist operations often end in failure or inaction. European nations can assess if the Russian state is supporting an extremist group within their country using a provided list of indicators as one line of effort.

This article addresses the second assertion, finds that DEI proponents have failed to provide evidence to support their position, and concludes that preferences for domestically-defined demographic groups cannot improve the performance of foreign-focused intelligence services. Such claims primarily reflect ideological views popular in government and the academy as well as the personal, parochial interests of persons from the favored groups. Instead, the traditional view of the value of diversity remains accurate: capable individual persons with different skills from all major demographic groups are primary drivers of excellent intelligence performance.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XPNJHAQD,2023-04-03,John A.

The article analyzes four possible scenarios in which a Soviet/Russian intelligence or state security officer might be considered “former,” organized around the concepts of legitimate and illegitimate ways of leaving the service, as well as genuine and deceptive reasons. Those two concept pairs create a matrix of possibilities for Soviet intelligence and state security personnel who consider leaving the service: legitimate/genuine, made up of officers who leave with no negative ramifications; legitimate/deceptive, made up of officers who claim to leave the service but remain connected; illegitimate/genuine, made up of defectors and arrested officers; and illegitimate/deceptive, made up of false defectors. Whether the statement “there is no such thing as a former chekist” is true depends on whom one asks: those who claim to have genuinely left the service would refute the statement, while those who are still in a Russian intelligence or state security service, as well as those whose departure is not genuine, hold firmly to it.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VCB7UN5P,2023-04-03,Kevin Riehle,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2024-01-26T17:21:43Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

It is an important tool in countering today’s complex transnational threats, but at the same time, cooperation is a risky business. Intelligence services can never be sure that a partner will reciprocate in kind. Scholars and practitioners often identify trust as one of the foremost conditions to overcome this dilemma. Yet the notion of trust is seldomly conceptualized in these rational-calculative explanations. Contrary to the common view that intelligence services are exceptional in their opportunism and rivalry, social relations and trustworthiness perceptions provide a more dominant explanation for the level of cooperation between intelligence partners than is often assumed by scholars and practitioners. Known reputations, recognized professional standards, and shared traits socially bind intelligence professionals to their community of practice, enabling them to bridge divides like nationality and even conflicting interests. Intelligence services resemble many other organizations in the public and private domains, requiring a de-exceptionalization of their international cooperation.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/UI32GSJS,2023-04-03,"Pepijn Tuinier, Thijs Brocades Zaalberg, Sebastiaan Rietjens",,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2024-01-26T17:20:29Z,['7R9UG9WU']

These considerations become especially relevant in paternalistic cultural contexts, such as Afghanistan. Potential obstacles (e.g., myths) for female intelligence as well as past attempts at implementation (e.g., female engagement teams) are reviewed, before four areas of concern are identified that must be addressed in the future. The analysis is expanded by presenting survey and interview data from a sample of Bundeswehr operatives with human intelligence experience in paternalistic countries. We suggest how to address existing concerns and increase the actionability of field human intelligence units by incorporating females as valuable assets on both sides of the military intelligence collection process.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6FNYJWPZ,2022-10-02,"Stephan Lau, Farina T.

160,From the “Lavender Scare” to “Out and Equal”: LGBTQIA+ Diversity in the U.S. Intelligence Community,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/08850607.2022.2060693,"Like most formal organizations in the United States, the agencies in the Intelligence Community (IC) have historically comprised white men and reflected their stories and interests. In the last few decades, however, the agencies have made efforts to diversify the workforce along multiple dimensions of inequality. In response to these initiatives, researchers—to include the agencies themselves—have sought to understand and elevate the experiences of officers who identify outside of the white and male demographics, with race, ethnicity, and gender as the primary targets of these studies. In contrast, it is only in the last few years that the agencies have made efforts to increase the visibility and sense of belonging among the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual or ally, and other sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQIA+) population in the IC. LGBTQIA + intelligence officers work in a career with a particularly fraught history: it began with the so-called Lavender Scare in the 1950s—a period during which gay and lesbian government officers were considered security risks—and it was legal for them to be fired for this reason until 1995. With a short history marked by rapid change, research on this population has been relatively slow and scant to date. What do we know about the experiences of LGBTQIA + intelligence officers, and where do we go next? This article will consider these questions and explore opportunities and challenges that the structures and cultures of the IC present to the LGBTQIA + population.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/74BP7KDS,2022-10-02,Bridget Rose Nolan,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2024-01-26T17:13:14Z,['7R9UG9WU']

Research including U.S. intelligence officers conducted in the 2020–2021 timeframe suggests insight into these shortcomings by way of misaligned perspectives that diverged along group lines between core mission professionals, compliance officers, and institutional leaders. These perspectival misalignments suggest a need for more cross-group collective solutions that better reflect the experiences of intelligence officers in targeted groups.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/P7SL9YA7,2022-10-02,Greta E.

162,Expanding Mental Models in Intelligence Through Diverse Perspectives,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/08850607.2022.2047534,"Intelligence organizations need a workforce that draws on a variety of perspectives, as do other types of organizations. The U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) was created to address the conflict situations of the last century. The early workforce reflected the requirements of that time; it had strong ties to the military, was of primarily European heritage, Judeo-Christian morality, was righteous about democracy, and mostly male. Today’s security problems extend well beyond situations of state conflict, to include transnational crime, crises of the natural environment, and other fluid issues that defy the previous expectations. National security intelligence workforces must be both knowledgeable and agile. This combination of knowledge and mental agility is, paradoxically, difficult to achieve. The heritage of the IC created modes of thinking that are at odds with the current need to imaginatively consider interconnected factors and various perspectives. The IC is stymied by its own culture, structures, processes, policies, and thinking patterns. Increased inclusion of diverse points of view will better enable assessment of complex, dynamic global issues. This article discusses mental frameworks as they affect intelligence work, drawing conclusions about the value of diversity in an intelligence and national security workforce.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/KICBLDBG,2022-10-02,Julie Mendosa,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2024-01-26T17:11:55Z,['CK5MNYPQ']
163,Beyond Blame: What Investigations of Intelligence Failures Can Learn from Aviation Safety,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/08850607.2021.1924102,"Investigations into intelligence failures are frequently conducted by multiple parties in parallel, and in several important cases, their conclusions have been controversial. In addition, investigations into minor incidents, such as mishandling of sensitive information or equipment, tradecraft errors, or similar events where no major consequences have been detected, tend to be handled internally by the concerned agency, or through limited interagency cooperation. This can lead to missed opportunities to prevent them from developing into major failures. These issues are compared to the investigative procedures employed in the aviation safety sector, where an independent body is responsible for investigating both major failures and minor incidents, with a view specifically to develop proactive measures to prevent repetition. The conclusion presented is that the Intelligence Community could benefit from studying how aviation safety investigations are handled, in order to be more effective in addressing minor incidents at an early stage, and to avoid controversies in investigations of major events.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/V896GKHT,2022-07-03,Tony Ingesson,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2024-01-26T17:11:17Z,['D7XFV7JL']

The information technology (IT) that agencies develop follows the contours of how agencies use data in furtherance of their objectives. Therefore, it can be read as a microcosm of agencies writ large. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)’s use of IT provides a case study of this. IT evolved to serve the needs of individual programs (e.g., counterintelligence, criminal investigations) and only once this had occurred did the FBI begin to develop a corporate enterprise architecture aimed at integrating the organization’s multiple facets. Examining the evolution of the FBI’s IT serves multiple purposes. From a historical perspective it provides insights into the institutional thought process, reflected in IT decisions, that drove operations. It also provides a lens through which to assess future development of IT systems—specifically, how an IT decision will impact the FBI’s culture and ability to effectively carry out its mission.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PB4GS4VF,2022-07-03,Darren E.

One of the latest virtualization technologies, containerization, provides new capabilities with a thin layer on end-user desktop computers in the field of distributed computing. From the viewpoint of management information systems, the information is the key element in decisionmaking processes, and in the age of the Internet the information that is necessary for organizations is accessible from publicly available open sources. Every organization needs to operate an open-source intelligence process to use the open-source data in different levels of management. However, the problem is that each organization needs data scientists and hardware and software resources to fulfill this requirement.

166,The Atomic Spy Who Never Was: “Perseus” and KGB/SVR Atomic Espionage Disinformation,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/08850607.2021.1894835,"In the late 1980s and early 1990s the KGB and its successor SVR began a campaign to claim a large share of credit for the USSR’s development of an atomic bomb. Memoirs by KGB officers celebrated their service’s success in penetrating the American “Manhattan” project. As part of this campaign, in 1991, Vladimir Chikov, a serving KGB (later SVR) officer, published an article in Russian and English, followed by a full-length book in French (1996), German (1996), and Russian (1997) on the exploits of an atomic superspy code named “Perseus,” said to still be alive and unknown to American security. “Perseus” was described as a senior physicist who was part of the Manhattan project from its origins, working first at the Chicago “Med” lab with Enrico Fermi and later at Los Alamos with Robert Oppenheimer. Veteran KGB officer Anatoly Yatskov, who had supervised several spies in the Manhattan project, added his endorsement of the “Perseus” story. For years, amateur and professional researchers used the clues in Chikov’s writings to search for the identity of “Perseus,” but no strong candidate emerged. With the opening of the Venona decryptions in 1995, most professional historians became convinced that “Perseus” was a KGB/SVR fiction, but “Perseus” lingers still with the wider public as a yet unidentified Soviet atomic spy. This article points to the internal contradictions and impossible assertions in Chikov’s “Perseus” story, as well as how Venona shows that Chikov took elements of the story of a real Soviet spy, Theodor Hall, to construct the “Perseus” myth. Hall was a junior scientist without an advanced degree who worked at Los Alamos in 1944 and 1945 (never at Chicago), but Chikov moved Hall’s story back to 1942 and elevated him from a junior figure to a senior scientist and associate of Fermi and Oppenheimer who, in Chikov’s words, gave Stalin “the Manhattan project on a serving plate.” Further, Chikov gave “Perseus” numerous attributes that precluded the still living Hall from ever being a candidate for the atomic spy “Perseus.”",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/2QT3T7DX,2022-07-03,"John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr",,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2024-01-26T17:08:56Z,['CZT6L9T7']

Changes in structure, policies, and personnel were accompanied by ardent disputes, mostly centering on the counterintelligence services. With the Cold War drawing to an end and the bipolar world beginning to disintegrate, intelligence work seemed redundant. Activities against countries that became Czechoslovakia’s partners after 40 years of the Cold War were halted, and ties with its patron, the State Committee for Security (KGB), were severed. The diplomatic cover that intelligence officers had used for years was now seen as unacceptable, which meant that the service suddenly lost its stations abroad. The initial period of major changes and restructuring in 1990 was followed by routine operations starting in 1990–1991, which was relatively calm and lasted until the breakup of the Czechoslovak Federation. In spring 1993, the Czech Intelligence Council was established to ensure oversight of the Intelligence Community, and the foreign intelligence service gradually improved its relations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The first transformation stage and the factual establishment of the Office for Foreign Relations and Information were completed by passing the Act on Intelligence Services in July 1994.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZCKTEBIL,2022-04-03,"Petr Kaňák, Jiří Piškula, Jiřina Dvořáková",,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2024-01-26T16:42:55Z,"['CK5MNYPQ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

In creating the Serbian intelligence and security system, there was a lot of wandering, unclear solutions, and misunderstandings—understandable given the historical and political context in which the creation of the system took place. The Serbian intelligence and security system consists of three services coordinated by the Coordination Bureau, which belongs to the National Security Council.

For the first time in history, there is empirical data available that allow for an analysis of the role of the Bulgarian secret police and its “afterlife” after 1990. Bulgarian intelligence archives, which were made partly accessible following the country’s admission to the European Union in 2007, provide an excellent basis for an analysis of the relationship between the DS and the Soviet State Committee for Security, the transformation of the Bulgarian security apparatus in 1990, attempts to disclose the state security archives, and continuous infiltration of Bulgarian politics, institutions, and security apparatus by former agents of the communist intelligence and security apparatus. The empirical data suggest that personal connections, dependencies, and informal networks of former DS agents and officials played an important role during the transformation period in Bulgaria and are at least partly responsible for political corruption, continuous Russian influence, a high degree of politicization of the Bulgarian security apparatus, misuse of intelligence and illegal surveillance practices, and a high degree of domestic and international mistrust and (dis-)loyalty.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6EVNSL3S,2022-04-03,Christopher Nehring,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2024-01-26T16:41:40Z,"['CZT6L9T7', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

More specifically, it illuminates the implications of the Soviet cover-up operation and its ultimate failure, particularly due to the efforts of the American intelligence community, including the CIA. American technological progress and intelligence were instrumental to the CIA’s understandings of the damage caused by Chernobyl, the dynamics of decontamination and its ethnic discriminatory practices, as well as the extent of the Soviet disinformation campaign. Importantly, Soviet active measures designed to obscure the scale and the consequences of the disaster had the opposite effect from what was expected, helping the American intelligence community accurately predict the potential political crisis in the USSR exacerbated by the Soviet cover-up operations and state violence.

Security services on both sides of the Iron Curtain were an important tool for gathering information on the enemy and for destroying political opponents. Moscow and its allies readily used their secret services for their purposes, both international and domestic. During the Cold War, the State Committee for Security (KGB) tightened its links to intelligence and counterintelligence services of the Soviet Bloc (SB) countries. One example of such cooperation is the joint operation of the KGB and the SB—Security Service of the Polish People’s Republic—in the 1970s and 1980s, called Operation Kaskada, and its subset, Operation Kama. The KGB and SB actions focused on compromising expat activists of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and on finding their allies in the USSR and Poland. The strategies used by both intelligence services led to closing a courier route from the West into the USSR and to seizing a contingent of documents that Moscow then used expertly for its propaganda and political ends. Given its efficacy, the operative model used by the Soviet intelligence agents is in all probability still used by Russian intelligence and counterintelligence services.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/K4P73BLD,2022-04-03,Dariusz J.

It is contended that the CIA suffers from (1) long-standing structural weaknesses that denied intelligence community coherence; (2) perverse promotion incentives that encouraged incorrect actions & attitudes; & cultural pathologies manifest in parochialism, resistance to change, & the overriding importance of security, ie, ""need to know."" In light of these organizational problems, Malaysia tracking failure is evaluated in terms of eleven missed opportunities in the areas of watchlisting, information sharing, & analysis. Criticisms centered on the vast amount of information that intelligence analysts must grapple with, ie, the signal-to-noise ratio, are rejected. Attention is then given to how organizational deficiencies fundamentally, if less apparently, undermined the CIA's ability to prevent the 9/11 attacks by crippling the agency's capacity to generate more disruption opportunities; long-term human intelligence collection efforts & strategic analysis capabilities critical to ""collecting the dots"" & ""connecting the dots"" early on were weakened.

Consequently, he deposits another dense layer of evidence to sift, sort, and evaluate. But an assessment of Tsarev's volume also leads to three major points. Admittedly, two are glimpses of the blindingly obvious,” restated here because these fundamentals become buried under media hype. First, that new historical evidence requires careful interpretation. Second, the secrets spies gather should be evaluated within the context of national and institutional policy formulation and implementation. Third, the notion of damage” from Soviet espionage, has been exaggerated and misunderstood, and it is now time to investigate the impact of Soviet espionage upon national and international politics. And, most relevantly, Tsarev, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, also serves as a consultant to the Service's press department.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/I2TARU8X,2001-01-01,Sheila Kerr,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2024-01-25T20:04:42Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

This thesis argues that the most effective way to understand and grasp the SO is closely related to the conceptualization of the term, “Teşkilat-ı Mahsusa”. In this way, a simple definitional model of the SO is produced, thus eliminating some ambiguities about the subject from the outset. This definition emphasizing the nature of the SO is also expected to act as an epistemic guide for the clarification of the operational and administrative characteristics of the SO.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/EA9Q5IH6,2012-09-01,Polat Safi,,,2020-06-05T10:17:16Z,"['BNPYHVD4', '4BH8AYZE', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

This may be attributed to certain methodological and linguistic shortcomings of particular studies and a general laziness in the use of existing primary and secondary sources. It is also an outcome of the degree to which contemporary political and ideological currents and concerns colour the nature of the historical inquiry into the subject. Based on a comprehensive and systematic critical reading of existing literature in the light of certain sets of hitherto unused archival material, the present study aims to re-open to discussion such historiographical problems both by revisiting the most speculative, and well-trodden, research topics in the literature, such as the very nature of the organization as well as its administrative features, and offering insights into the potential(s) of certain little-explored Turkish archives.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/747NHZT7,2012-01-30,Polat Safi,,Middle Eastern Studies,2020-06-05T10:17:16Z,"['BNPYHVD4', '4BH8AYZE', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

However, the Turkish leadership demonstrated repeated doubts and hesitancy about Western aims even when the Axis forces were in its doorstep, fearing a possible Anglo-Soviet agreement regarding Turkey which would ultimately jeopardize the country’s political and territorial integrity. As the host country of the signals intelligence facilities, the Turks did not simply tried to take their share from the intelligence, endeavoured to direct the intelligence liaison in their favour. Particularly Ankara employed intelligence diplomacy as a mechanism to maintain the country’s independence and territorial integrity.

Australia was no exception. Japanese diplomats based in Sydney worked closely with Japanese corporations and local enablers in coordinating covert and overt activities which assisted Japan in preparing for war in the Pacific, and ultimately for war against Australia. Although Japan failed to collect high value military intelligence against Australia, and its subtle and well-organised local propaganda campaign could not erase negative public perceptions of Japanese militarism in China, its vast economic intelligence collection activities likely proved highly useful in rebuilding post-war relations with Australia.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XAEFVL36,2019-01-02,James Llewelyn,,Journal of Intelligence History,2022-03-03T15:56:23Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'MP7FJ9UA', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

806,The Sentinel State: Surveillance and the Survival of Dictatorship in China,Book,https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674257832,"Countering recent hype around technology, a leading expert argues that the endurance of dictatorship in China owes less to facial recognition AI and GPS tracking than to the human resources of the Leninist surveillance state.For decades China watchers argued that economic liberalization and increasing prosperity would bring democracy to the world’s most populous country. Instead, the Communist Party’s grip on power has only strengthened. Why? The answer, Minxin Pei argues, lies in the effectiveness of the Chinese surveillance state. And the source of that effectiveness is not just advanced technology like facial recognition AI and mobile phone tracking. These are important, but what matters more is China’s vast, labor-intensive infrastructure of domestic spying.Central government data on Chinese surveillance is confidential, so Pei turned to local reports, police gazettes, leaked documents, and interviews with exiled dissidents to provide a detailed look at the evolution, organization, and tactics of the surveillance state. Following the 1989 Tiananmen uprising, the Chinese Communist Party invested immense resources in a coercive apparatus operated by a relatively small number of secret police officers capable of mobilizing millions of citizen informants to spy on those suspected of disloyalty. The CCP’s Leninist bureaucratic structure—whereby officials and party activists penetrate every sector of society and the economy, from universities and village committees to delivery companies, telecommunication firms, and Tibetan monasteries—ensures that Beijing’s eyes and ears are truly everywhere.While today’s system is far more robust than that of years past, it is modeled after mass surveillance implemented under Mao Zedong and Chinese emperors centuries ago. Rigorously empirical and rich in historical insight, The Sentinel State is a singular contribution to our knowledge about coercion in the Chinese state and, more generally, the survival strategies of authoritarian regimes.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/WHBJADQZ,2024-02-13,Minxin Pei,Harvard University Press,,2024-01-25T11:50:49Z,"['28B8SB3Y', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

First, this paper describes the CIA’s covert affairs regarding the making of the film, and then it examines the specific factors that encouraged governmental control over the movie Animal Farm.

Highlighting both similarities and differences across different cultural, economic, geographical, ethnic and political landscapes, the perspective laid out in this paper is an argument in favour of systematic and sustained comparative approaches to asymmetric warfare.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Z3PD8YWQ,2024-01-21,Andrei Miroiu,,Journal of Balkan and Near Eastern Studies,2024-01-25T11:46:39Z,"['CZT6L9T7', 'TLFN4NAL', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Towns held hostage by ransomware. Corporate websites hacked. Cyber espionage and cybercrimes are increasing in both frequency and sophistication—requiring the collection of actionable intelligence in order to combat them. Constance Uthoff provides a comprehensive overview of cyber intelligence, explaining what it is, why it is needed, who is doing it, and how it is done.

Notably, Cyber Intelligence:

• Outlines the roles of the major US intelligence agencies involved.
• Assesses significant laws and policies from the 1990s to the present.
• Compares methods and best practices across the public and private sectors.
• Looks beyond the US to explore the capabilities of actors like China, Iran, and Russia.
• Includes real-world examples and case studies.

The result is an in-depth examination of the processes and applications of spying in cyberspace, accessible to a wide range of readers.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/W7GIMZED,2022-01-01,Constance S. Uthoff,Lynne Rienner Publishers,,2024-01-25T11:43:11Z,['8XXD789V']

The Hidden War in Argentina reveals the stories of the spymasters, British, Americans and Germans who plotted against each other throughout the Second World War in Argentina. In Buenos Aires, Johannes Siegfried Becker – codename 'Sargo' – was the man responsible for organizing most of the Nazi intelligence gathering in Latin America and the leader of 'Operation Bolivar', which sought to bring South America into the war on the side of the Axis powers. After the attack on Pearl Harbor the US state department pressured every South American country to join it in declaring war on Germany, and J Edgar Hoover authorized huge investments in South American intelligence operations. Argentina continued to refuse to join the conflict, triggering a US embargo that squeezed the country's economy to breaking point. Buenos Aires continued to be a hub for espionage even as the war in Europe was ending – hundreds of high-ranking Nazi exiles sought refuge there.

This book is based on newly declassified files and details of the operations of MI6, the Abwehr, the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and the FBI, as well as the OSS and the SOE. Most significantly, The Hidden War in Argentina reveals for the first time the coups of Britain's MI6 in South America.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/R75CN2HR,2019,Panagiotis Dimitrakis,Bloomsbury,,2022-03-03T15:25:54Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Specifically, we analyse documents that demonstrate that the Swiss company Crypto AG—a supplier of cryptographic equipment to more than 120 countries—was controlled by the CIA. We analyse the implications of this for Brazil, in a comparative perspective with the experience of these other nations. Our methodology includes: (1) analysis of documents recently declassified by the US and Brazil; (2) analysis of budget expenditure data; (3) information made available by Crypto AG on its international operations. In our conclusion, we highlight the irrefutability of the relationship established between the CIA and Crypto AG, which lasted from the 1950s to 2018.

This work answers the following questions: why was the partnership stable despite acute ideological divergences? What major obstacles plagued their relations? Was Czechoslovakia active in the fight against the military regime due to its international com- mitments within the Eastern bloc? The results suggest that two major facts were decisive for the stable position of Czechoslovakia in Brazil: a strong tradition of bilateral relations and that both sides saw econom- ic advantages in keeping the mutual trade flows.

Drawing on a wealth of unpublished documents from the KGB's secret files and on rare interviews with victims as well as interrogators, Albats chronicles the KGB's evolution into the world's largest secret police force. She shows how it infiltrated every structure of civil society and every aspect of daily life; how it choreographed the ""unsuccessful"" coup of August 1991; and how, despite its official dissolution in the new democratic Russia, the KGB is stronger than ever, having transformed itself from an instrument of state power to a state power in its own right.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/CU4KJHQ6,1994-10-01,"Yevgenia Albats, Catherine A.

842,"Secrecy, spies and the global South: intelligence studies beyond the ‘Five Eyes’ alliance",Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiz200,"The study of secrecy and spies remain subjects dominated by Anglo-American experiences. In recent years there has been some effort to refocus the lens of research upon ‘intelligence elsewhere’, including the global South. This is partly because of intense interest in the Arab Spring and ‘managed democracy’, placing a wider range of secret services under the spotlight. However, the approach to research is still dominated by concepts and methods derived from studying the English-speaking states of the ‘Five Eyes’ alliance and their European outriders. This article calls for a re-examination of research strategies for Intelligence Studies and for those theorizing surveillance, suggesting that both fields have much to learn from area studies and development studies, especially in the realm of research practice and ethics. If the growing number of academics specializing in intelligence genuinely wish to move forward and examine the global South they will need to rethink their tool-kit and learn from other disciplines. We suggest there is a rich tradition to draw upon.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/999XKD4G,2019-11-01,"Zakia Shiraz, Richard J.

This article aims to discuss the role of culture during peace operations in particular, and population-centric military operations in general. In this context, the concept of cultural intelligence is discussed through the concepts of ‘power’, ‘intelligence’, and ‘culture’. The theoretical discussion raises the importance of cultural intelligence for the exercise of soft and smart power in operational areas. NATO’s International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan was chosen as a case study and the data were collected through interviews with an expert group of 45 individuals. These interviewees with field experience in peace operations provided a foundation for widening the theoretical approach. The article concludes with the interpretation of the obtained data. The research findings prove that the skill of conquering people’s hearts and minds in operation environments can be developed through cultural intelligence, and military leaders/political decision-makers should not neglect cultural intelligence as a soft power tool in peace operations as well as in population-centric military operations.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/P4VT5VA3,2017-05-27,"Haldun Yalçınkaya, Yusuf Özer",,International Peacekeeping,2024-01-24T16:04:51Z,"['WHBCJ8GW', '7R9UG9WU']"

In this riveting memoir, Cherkashin provides a remarkable insider’s view of the KGB’s prolonged conflict with the United States, from his recruitment through his rising career in counterintelligence to his prime spot as the KGB’s number- two man at the Soviet Embassy in Washington. Victor Cherkashin’s story will shed stark new light on the KGB’s inner workings over four decades and reveal new details about its major cases. Cherkashin’s story is rich in episode and drama. He took part in some of the highest-profile Cold War cases, including tracking down U.S. and British spies around the world. He was posted to stations in the U.S., Australia, India, and Lebanon and traveled the globe for operations in England, Europe, and the Middle East. But it was in 1985, known as “the Year of the Spy,” that Cherkashin scored two of the biggest coups of the Cold War. In April of that year, he recruited disgruntled CIA officer Aldrich Ames, becoming his principal handler. Refuting and clarifying other published versions, Cherkashin will offer the most complete account on how and why Ames turned against his country. Cherkashin will also reveal new details about Robert Hanssen’s recruitment and later exposure, as only he can. And he will address whether there is an undiscovered KGB spy-another Hanssen or Ames-still at large. Spy Handler will be a major addition to Cold War history, told by one of its key participants.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/S8I649B3,2005-11-01,"Victor Cherkashin, Gregory Feifer",Hachette Books,,2024-01-24T15:26:56Z,"['CZT6L9T7', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Not surprisingly, given the secrecy surrounding Soviet efforts in these areas, no biographical reference tools and few bibliographies have been published to date. In this context, Michael Parrish's work is a unique undertaking. In the first section to the volume, biographies are provided on some 4,000 officials in senior and mid-level positions who had served in Cheka, NKVD/RFSFR, GPU, KGB, and other organizations. Also included are officials of the Committee for State Control (formerly Ministry of State Control, and, before that, Commissariat of Workers and Peasants' Inspection). Prominent political personalities with earlier ties to security services, such as N.A. Bulganin, are listed even though such service formed only a brief part of their careers. Others listed include party officials, such as A.A. Kuznetsov, who at different times served as the Party's watchdog of security organs. Also included, because of their close association with repression and security organs, are members of Stalin's inner circle.

The second part of the volume is a survey of books in English published between 1917 and 1990 which related to Soviet security and intelligence organizations. This is followed by a biographical addendum, a glossary of terms, and material showing the development of Soviet security organizations. No one concerned with current intelligence issues and the role of security organizations in Soviet life can ignore this volume.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5Z8QDLB8,1992-01-30,Michael Parrish,Bloomsbury,,2024-01-24T15:18:59Z,"['CK5MNYPQ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

854,Spies without Cloaks: The KGB's Successors,Book,https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9781400821877/spies-without-cloaks,"This book offers a compelling and comprehensive account of what happened to the KGB when the Soviet Union collapsed and the world’s most powerful and dangerous secret police organization was uncloaked. As Amy Knight shows, the KGB was renamed and reorganized several times after it was officially disbanded in December 1991 — but it was not reformed. Knight’s rich and lively narrative begins with the aborted August 1991 coup, led by KGB hard-liners, and takes us through the summer of 1995, when the Russian parliamentary elections were looming on the horizon. The failed coup attempt was a setback for the KGB because it led to demands from Russian democrats for a complete overhaul of the security services. As a result, the KGB’s leaders were fired, its staff reduced, and its functions dispersed among several agencies. Even the elite foreign intelligence service was subjected to budget cuts. But President Yeltsin was reluctant to press on with reforms of the security services, because he needed their support in his struggle against mounting political opposition. Indeed, by the spring of 1995, the security services had regained much of what they had lost in the wake of the August coup. Some observers were even saying that they had acquired more power and influence than the old KGB.

This story told by one of the foremost experts on the Soviet/Russian security services and enriched by face-to-face interviews with security professionals in Moscow, is crucial to understanding Russian politics in transition. It will fascinate scholars, policymakers, and general readers interested in the fate of the KGB.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/E7PHDPTM,1997-12-22,Amy Knight,Princeton University Press,,2024-01-24T15:07:24Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']
855,Soviet Leaders and Intelligence: Assessing the American Adversary during the Cold War,Book,http://press.georgetown.edu/Book/Soviet-Leaders-and-Intelligence,"During the Cold War, the political leadership of the Soviet Union avidly sought intelligence about its main adversary, the United States. Although effective on an operational level, Soviet leaders and their intelligence chiefs fell short when it came to analyzing intelligence. Soviet leaders were often not receptive to intelligence that conflicted with their existing beliefs, and analysts were reluctant to put forward assessments that challenged ideological orthodoxy.

There were, however, important changes over time. Ultimately the views of an enlightened Soviet leader, Gorbachev, trumped the ideological blinders of his predecessors and the intelligence service’s dedication to an endless duel with their ideologically spawned “main adversary,"" making it possible to end the Cold War.

Raymond Garthoff draws on over five decades of personal contact with Soviet diplomats, intelligence officers, military leaders, and scholars during his remarkable career as an analyst, senior diplomat, and historian. He also builds on previous scholarship and examines documents from Soviet and Western archives. Soviet Leaders and Intelligence offers an informed and highly readable assessment of how the Soviets understood—and misunderstood—the intentions and objectives of their Cold War adversary.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/24MKBRHC,2015-08-01,Raymond L.

In 1999, they published the explosive bestseller The Sword and the Shield, which provided a complete account of KGB operations in Europe and America. In The World Was Going Our Way, Andrew now chronicles the KGB’s extensive penetration of governments throughout the Third World-the battlefield on which the U.S.S.R. sought to achieve global supremacy. Andrew’s definitive account fundamentally revises the history of the Cold War, and sheds new light on the state of the world today.

It argues that the development of the ‘anti-communist triangle’ (the security liaison between Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan) was largely influenced by British concern about the expansion of communist influence.

884,Governing the European Intelligence: Multilateral Intelligence Cooperation in the European Union,Journal article,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/ijps/issue/64480/900302,"Since intelligence is an essential part of national security, a high volume of cooperation in this area is not expected. An assessment of the literature shows that there are several obstacles to intelligence cooperation. More precisely, states are reluctant to involve in intelligence cooperation because of trust factors and other factors such as bureaucratic culture and resistance, regime type, lack of normative motivation and shared identities. Even if they are compelled to cooperate, they prefer bilateral intelligence cooperation. However, due to the globalization of national security threats in the last two decades, intelligence organizations are currently obliged to cooperate multilaterally even though they do not prefer to do so. Multilateral intelligence cooperation within the European Union is a unique example of relatively successful multilateral intelligence cooperation. On the one hand, official European intelligence agencies INTCEN and Europol provide the legal framework of intelligence cooperation among the Union. On the other hand, informal channels such as the Club of Berne are also proven useful for the EU’s intelligence cooperation. We argue that the relative success of European intelligence cooperation derives from at least three factors. These are institutionalized demand for intelligence governance, the delegated authority of the members of the EU’s (epistemic) intelligence community, and its ability to set the national security agenda of the EU.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9N6ZCC3G,2021-10-01,"Ahmet Ateş, Anıl Erkan",,International Journal of Politics and Security,2024-01-24T08:16:12Z,['HCN8YFI8']

889,Staring Down the Mukhabarat: Rhizomatic Social Movements and the Egyptian and Syrian Arab Spring,Thesis,https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/etd/5585,"Unable to enact change through the existing political institutions of their authoritarian regimes, and consistently repressed by state security forces (the mukhabarat), activists in Egypt and Syria relied on street activism to challenge their conditions. This study analyzes the Arab Spring uprisings in Egypt and Syria through the conceptual lens of a rhizome. Rhizomatic movements are horizontal, grassroots, and allow for the networking of local community-specific grievances, into larger national movements. This networking allows opposition members groups to build solidarity, construct collective identities, and develop a set of shared goals, strategies, and tactics. Furthermore, it provides for the transcendence of existing societal divides (such as religious, ideological, political, socio-cultural, and class), allowing participants to unite as a single force. Since a rhizome is horizontal and lacks a fixed structure, they are significantly more difficult to dismantle, as there is not a set leadership or hierarchy to target. Importantly, this rhizomatic logic integrates itself within the notion of viewing movements within larger cycles of protest or waves of contention. Rhizomatic movements are built through the praxis of networking, rather than through ideological networking. As such, the conditions and history of opposition movements provides important analytical considerations. This study, using process tracing, argues that the Egyptian revolution was rhizomatic in nature and thus able to pose a significant enough force to challenge Mubarak's regime. Although faced with brutal repression, activists remained coordinated, interconnected, and continued to mobilize. Conversely, the Syrian opposition, plagued by years of in-fighting among activists, was unable to develop as a rhizomatic force. Activists failed to sufficiently network, build collective identities, and develop common tactics. This hindered their ability to appeal to and mobilize large segments of the population that were discontent with Assad but still viewed him as the best option for their own interests. When faced with systematic suppression by Assad's regime, the opposition faltered, returning to their own respective individual self-interests and goals, allowing the regime to fragment their attempts at mobilization.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/JP4Y4KK4,2015-03-19,Stephen Strenges,,,2024-01-24T08:02:25Z,"['WHBCJ8GW', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"
890,The National Intelligence Estimate Mechanism in Israel,Journal article,https://www.inss.org.il/strategic_assessment/the-national-intelligence-estimate-mechanism-in-israel/,"This essay examines the process by which intelligence estimates at the national level are prepared and presented in Israel. Unlike Israel, where every intelligence organization presents its own estimate to the government, the United States and the United Kingdom operate a single organization – appointed by the President or the Cabinet – that is responsible for formulating the national intelligence estimate. While such an umbrella organization is not recommended for Israel, Israel would do well to adopt some aspects of the estimate preparation processes in those nations, e.g., the systematic clarification of agreements and disagreements among the intelligence organizations before the estimates are presented to the government. In addition, absent an umbrella organization, the Military Intelligence Directorate in Israel should be left in charge of presenting national intelligence estimates, i.e., in charge of integration and the overall situation estimate. As such, the political echelon would be presented with a full and integrated intelligence estimate as well as a breakdown of the major issues and fundamental disagreements among the respective intelligence organizations.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9J3BGYDN,2015-04-01,"David Siman-Tov, Shmuel Even",,Strategic Assessment,2024-01-24T07:59:11Z,"['CZJ36V8L', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

The author explains how the major events in the Middle East affected Saudi Arabia's foreign policy orientation. It shows how Saudi Arabia's policy toward Israel was affected by the deterioration in Saudi-Egyptian relations, by its quest for security in the Arabian Gulf region and by its aspiration to hegemony in the Middle East. The author argues that Saudi Arabia's policy toward Israel remained far less hostile than that of the Arab states surrounding Israel. In addition, it argues that it was not until 1973 that Saudi Arabia became seriously involved in the attempt to pressure Israel to withdraw from the territories it occupied in the Six-Day War. The author concludes by showing that neither Saudi Arabia's acquisition of the intelligence-gathering AWACS aircraft, nor Israel's invasion of Lebanon or the massacre of Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila had a serious impact on the bilateral relations, and that it was not until the emergence of the Iranian nuclear threat that Saudi Arabia's relations with Israel began to improve.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZBVYLUUX,2019-05-04,Jacob Abadi,,Middle Eastern Studies,2024-01-24T07:56:54Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

Despite its aura of scientific exactitude, nuclear intelligence is complex and susceptible to methodological disagreements and political bias at the international oversight level—the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)—and within the countries involved in the rollback project – Israel and the United States.

To highlight both the technological problems of assessing compliance and the politicization, each chapter in the book uses a real-time comparison of the nuclear developments in Iran, and the perception of Israel and the United States. This methodology yielded some significant results. Essentially, two camps had formed in each country; those who were pushing for an agreement with Iran and those who opposed it.
The Israeli intelligence agencies – the Mossad and the Military Intelligence – as well as the highly secretive Israeli Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) which advised them considered the program to be weak and slow moving. The right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu suggested that Iran was steps away from the “point of no return,” making it an existential threat to Israel.

A virtually identical split emerged in Washington. While the intelligence community and the advising scientists from the National Nuclear Laboratories, considered Iran progress to be relatively modest, the Republicans and the Israel lobby - the Jewish organizations and the Christian Zionists— warned of the imminent danger of a nuclear Iran.

With the Obama administration pushing for the JCPOA, a fierce debate took place in Congress. The Israeli intelligence and military chiefs led by the Mossad chief Meir Dagan, which had previously blocked Netanyahu from a preemptive action, quietly supported the agreement. In Washington, the Israel lobby, and the Republicans, helped by Netanyahu, mounted an all-out effort to defeat the deal in Congress. The pro-deal coalition fought back by mobilizing the scientific community, military and intelligence officials, the business lobby, and grassroots Democrats.
The JCPOA represents the first successful effort of peaceful counterproliferation. At the same, excessive politicization has clouded its legitimacy and cast doubt about its future.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IMKVY9DV,2018-06-01,"Ofira Seliktar, Farhad Rezaei",Rowman & Littlefield,,2024-01-24T07:55:19Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

These hitherto undisclosed episodes in Israel’s diplomatic history are revealed for the first time by the contributors to this volume, who explore how relations based upon patronage and personal friendships, as well as ties born from kinship and realpolitik both informed the creation of the state and later defined Israel’s relations with a host of actors, both state and non-state. The authors focus on the extent to which Israel’s clandestine diplomacies have indeed been regarded as purely functional and subordinate to a realist quest for security amid the perceived hostility of a predominantly Muslim-Arab world, or have in fact proved to be manifestations of a wider acceptance — political, social and cultural — of a Jewish sovereign state as an intrinsic part of the Middle East. They also discuss whether clandestine diplomacy has been more effective in securing Israeli objectives than reliance upon more formal diplomatic ties constrained by international legal obligations and how this often complex and at times contradictory matrix of clandestine relationships continues to influence perceptions of Israel’s foreign policy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HN4RVVD7,2013-05-01,"Clive Jones, Tore T.

In 1997, the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad poisoned Hamas leader Khalid Mishal in broad daylight on the streets of Amman, Jordan. As the little-known Palestinian leader slipped into a coma, the Mossad agents’ escape was bungled and the episode quickly spiraled into a diplomatic crisis. A series of high-stakes negotiations followed, which ultimately saved Mishal and set the stage for his phenomenal political ascendancy.

In Kill Khalid, acclaimed reporter Paul McGeough reconstructs the history of Hamas through exclusive interviews with key players across the Middle East and in Washington, including unprecedented access to Mishal himself, who remains to this day one of the most powerful and enigmatic figures in the region. A “sobering reminder of how little has been achieved during sixty years of Israeli efforts in Palestine” (Kirkus), Kill Khalid tracks Hamas’s political fortunes across a decade of suicide bombings, political infighting, and increasing public support, culminating in the battle for Gaza in 2007 and the current-day political stalemate.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Z7KPIGVC,2010-03-01,Paul McGeough,The New Press,,2024-01-23T23:26:08Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

914,The Role of Intelligence Activity in the Building of Israel and its Identity,Journal article,https://koreascience.kr/article/JAKO201528638840885.page,"The purpose of this article is to examine Israeli intelligence activity which had contributed to the building of Israel and of its national identity. In the late 19th, the Jews scattered around the world had shared the image of victims shaped in the history of the persecution. In this process, intelligence activity was a staple factor which established the state of Israel; political and religious community. Fighting against Arabs, Israel's intelligence agents had played key role in migrating Jews to Palestine and building their own state. In other words, Intelligence activity was the instrument of implementing political Zionism, Jewish nationalism. Even after independence in 1948, despite the opposition of Arab, Israeli intelligence agencies had persuaded the United States and the Soviet Union to recognize Israel as a member of the international society. Arab countries, nevertheless, had regarded Israel as 'a state to be disappeared', and its national identity was totally denied. However, Israel officially gained recognition for statehood through Arab-Israeli war and summit talks with Egypt. Israel finally restored the 'Promised Land' that is recorded in the Bible and established its identity of a winner. In conclusion, Israeli intelligence agency played a decisive role in founding the nation and even forming the consciousness of the people.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/DVFZD98S,2015,Jae-Wang Seok,,Korean Security Journal,2024-01-23T19:25:52Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

This book adds a unique dimension to previously disclosed material, as its author served as head of the Research Branch of Israeli Military Intelligence on the eve of and during the Yom Kippur War and as such was responsible for the national intelligence assessment at the time. Drawing on his personal records, and on interviews and extensive research conducted in the intervening decades, Aryeh Shalev examines the preconceptions and common beliefs that prevailed among Israeli intelligence officials and ultimately contributed to their flawed assessment: the excessive self-confidence in Israel's prowess, particularly in the aftermath of the Six Day War; the confidence that any surprise attack could be repelled with the regular army until the reserves were mobilised; the accepted profile of Sadat as a weak leader with limited powers and initiative; and the belief in Israel's correct understanding of Egyptian and Syrian operational plans . . . Beyond explaining where Israeli intelligence erred, the book probes expectations of military intelligence in general and the relationship between military and political assessments. It considers what kind of assessment an intelligence branch is capable of producing with a great degree of certainty, and conversely, what kind of assessment it should not be asked to produce. Based on the intelligence failure of the Yom Kippur War, this book also reviews possible organisational changes and methodological improvements to guard as much as possible against surprise attacks in the future, relevant not only to Israel's circumstances but to all countries with enemies capable of launching an attack.

Did he jump or was he pushed? He is identified as an Egyptian millionaire who has been living in the UK since the early 1980s. His name is Ashraf Marwan. But that is only part of the tale, for Marwan was also an international businessman and arms dealer, married to Mona Abdel Nasser, daughter of the legendary Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser. A few years before, I blew Marwan's cover, unmasking him as a top spy who had been working for Egypt's biggest enemy - Israel. But there is a twist - one that even the most audacious writer of fiction might baulk at. Soon after I exposed him, Marwan made contact. We met, became friends, and then kept in touch for almost five years. The day before he plunges to his death, Marwan phones. He is anxious and shaken and he asks for an urgent face-to-face meeting. We schedule it for the next day. It never takes place. Around the time we are due to meet, Marwan's body is found in the private rose garden below his flat in central London. This is the story of what came to be known as 'The Marwan Affair', which shocked the public and the Intelligence community. It is based on my diary notes; together with messages I sent Marwan over the years they tell the inside story of my relationship with the spy some call the greatest secret agent of the twentieth century",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9TKLJCPZ,2016,Ahron Bregman,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform,,2024-01-23T19:06:46Z,"['ZMVDB8A2', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

In theory, intelligence work should be objective, autonomous, and free of political influence; at its best, it should be guided solely by the professional ethic of intelligence.

In tracing and explaining the effects of these pressures and interests on the behavior of intelligence organizations and individuals, Uri Bar-Joseph analyzes four cases of intelligence intervention in politics: the 1961 Bay of Pigs episode; the 1954 Israeli ""Unfortunate Business Affair""; the 1920 British ""Henry Wilson Affair""; and the 1924 “Zinoviev Letter Affair.""",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IUII7W33,1995-01-01,Uri Bar-Joseph,Penn State University Press,,2024-01-23T18:57:48Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

This is a history of Israel's espionage and security network from 1948 until the present day.

The key distinction remains the notion of threat of intentional action to cause harm: this is the central preoccupation of intelligence agencies that would not normally consider risks that might arise from, say, the unintended outcomes of accidents or interrupted supplies of resources. Another distinction is that intelligence is normally preoccupied with increasing knowledge in conditions of ignorance or uncertainty, while risk analysis is more likely to be quantifiable. The perception of a ‘new terrorism’ has led to the importation of the ‘precautionary principle’ to intelligence with potentially dangerous consequences for democracy.

927,TUNISIA’S NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Why “Rogue Elephants” Fail to Reform,Book,https://www.newacademia.com/books/tunisias-national-intelligence-why-rogue-elephants-fail-to-reform/,"Drawing on extensive fieldwork and original data, this book examines the political and security evolution of Tunisia’s national intelligence in the post-independence era. It investigates the sophistication of the intelligence complex under Bin ʿAlī and its central role in entrenching his authoritarian rule. The increased politicization of intelligence services contributed to the consolidation of power and the abuse of Tunisian citizens through the pervasive securitization of the public and private spheres and the intrusive penetration of society. The wide-range of illegal activities by Tunisia’s intelligence services contributed to the establishment of a police security state. However, these services played a critical role in its weakening through their lack of professionalism, their opacity, and their systematic use of intelligence for repression and oppression purposes. The post-uprising era created a new dilemma for intelligence organs in terms of their adjustment to the new socio-political context. The absence of appropriate political vision for the role of intelligence within a fledgling democracy, the rise of insecurity in the country and across the region, and the legacy of authoritarianism are hindering any effort to introduce an appropriate “reform.” The difficult transition of the intelligence apparatus’ habits of state-centric security, which has been associated with the regime’s security, to the human-citizen security approach, is likely a major impediment to such reform. Thus, rather than a reform that entails democratic control, accountability, and oversight of the intelligence sector, the country’s secret apparatus experienced a mending process seeking mainly to improve its operational capabilities driven by the discourse of technicalities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IW27N7MR,2017,Noureddine Jebnoun,New Academia Publishing,,2024-01-23T18:28:23Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

Israel's Secret Wars is the first documented, comprehensive history of all three of Israel's intelligence services, from their origins in the 1930s, through Israel's five wars, up to the present, including the Ostrovsky affair. Highly readable and exhaustively researched, it contains the most accurate information available about a shadowy and controversial subject in which myth all too often obscures reality.

Ten years after 9/11, the intelligence machine is certainly bigger—but not necessarily better. American intelligence continues to privilege old-fashioned strategic analysis for policy-makers and exhibits a technocratic approach to asymmetric security threats, epitomized by the accelerated use of drone strikes and data-mining. Distinguished commentators have focused on the panacea of top-down reform, while politicians and practitioners have created entirely new agencies. However, these prescriptions for change remain conceptually limited because of underlying Anglo-Saxon presumptions about what intelligence is. Although intelligence is a global business, when we talk about intelligence we tend to use a vocabulary that is narrowly derived from the experiences of America and its English-speaking nebula. This article deploys the notion of strategic culture to explain why this is. It then explores the cases of China and South Africa to suggest how we might begin to rethink our intelligence communities and their tasks.

Today the Cold War is dead; there are fewer dictatorships; and 9/11 has created a whole new raison d'etre for covert action.

This book explains how the war on terrorism provides a wholly new context for the murky world secret services and intelligence agencies operate in, and describes in detail how ultra-modern new technologies have vastly increased their power to spy abroad and eavesdrop at home.

This up-to-date account raises important issues, including the new roles the secret services have found for themselves as they target 'rogue states', 'the war on drugs', and 'terrorists'. Most important of all, its authors explore the unsolved contradiction between the world of these secretive and unaccountable agencies operating on the fringes of the law, and the requirements of a free and democratic society.

Through official documents, press leaks, and personal memoirs, the project’s study reveals vulnerabilities in America’s intelligence apparatus, the converging and diverging anti-Soviet interests of Beijing and Washington, and a year-long covert diplomatic effort between Carter and Deng. In investigating the project that culminated in Chinese and American intelligence officials watching Soviet missile tests from a joint station, this paper reassesses the traditionally assumed archetypes of inter-state collaboration and uncovers a deeper level of U.S.-China Cold War cooperation than previously assumed.

Yet existing histories often take a single-state approach, neglecting how dynamics between co-instigators shaped the case studies. This article draws on recently declassified archival material to examine the supposed ‘joint’ US-UK covert action in Albania, a formative and significant case study of the early Cold War. It addresses the puzzle of why the Anglo-Americans intervened together despite not sharing common mission objectives, nor valuing each other’s contribution. Contrary to existing assumptions, the article finds that, as the operation developed, it had more to do with internal dynamics between the aligned states – efforts by London and Washington to influence each other – than with any commitment to undermine the Albanian regime. These findings – that the internal process came to outweigh the external outcome – reveal that Albania was less a cooperative joint endeavour and more an episode punctuated by manipulation and distrust between two supposed friends. This has important implications for wider understandings of the international history of covert action, as well as the impact of international cooperation, secrecy and ambiguity in shaping the objectives, execution and outcomes of covert action involving multiple actors.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/UZVFF5GM,2024-01-22,"Stephen Long, Rory Cormac",,The International History Review,2024-01-22T15:34:23Z,['B6RJNLTK']

In the sixteenth century, an intense rivalry between the Ottoman Empire and the Spanish Habsburg Empire and its allies spurred the creation of early modern intelligence. Translated into English for the first time, Emrah Safa Gürkan's Spies for the Sultan reconstructs this history of Ottoman espionage, sabotage, and bribery practices in the Mediterranean world.

Then as now, collecting political, naval, military, and economic information was essential to staying one step ahead of your rivals. Porous and shifting borders, the ability to assume multiple identities, and variable allegiances made conditions in this era ripe for espionage around the Mediterranean. The Ottomans used networks of merchants, corsairs, soldiers, and other travelers to move among their enemies and report intelligence from points far and wide. The Ottoman sultans invested in the novel technologies of cryptography and stenography. Ottoman intelligence operatives not only collected information but also used disinformation, bribery, and sabotage to subvert their enemies.

This history of early modern intelligence is based on extraordinary archival research in Turkey, Spain, Italy, Austria, and Croatia, and it provides important insights into the origins of modern intelligence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/UT4HMJQF,2024-05-01,Emrah Safa Gurkan,Georgetown University Press,,2024-01-22T10:40:59Z,"['DS3WDJUS', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Since its founding in 1995, the FSB, Russia’s Federal Security Service, has regained the majority of the domestic security functions of the Soviet-era KGB. Under Vladimir Putin, who served as FSB director just before becoming president, the agency has grown to be one of the most powerful and favored organizations in Russia. The FSB not only conducts internal security but also has primacy in intelligence operations in former Soviet states. Their activities include anti-dissident operations at home and abroad, counterintelligence, counterterrorism, criminal investigations of crimes against the state, and guarding Russia’s borders.

In The Russian FSB, Kevin P. Riehle provides a brief history of the FSB’s origins, placed within the context of Russian history, the government’s power structure, and Russia’s wider culture. He describes how the FSB’s mindset and priorities show continuities from the tsarist regimes and the Soviet era. The book’s chapters analyze origins, organizational structure, missions, leaders, international partners, and cultural representations such as the FSB in film and television.

Based on both English and Russian sources, this book is a well-researched introduction to understanding the FSB and its central role in Putin’s Russia.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/P98ZXEY8,2024-03-01,Kevin P.

This book illustrates that big data is transforming intelligence production as well as changing the national security environment broadly, including what is considered a part of national security as well as the relationships agencies have with the public. The book highlights the impact of big data on intelligence production and national security from the perspective of Australian national security leaders and practitioners, and the research is based on empirical data collection, with insights from nearly 50 participants from within Australia’s National Intelligence Community. It argues that big data is transforming intelligence and national security and shows that the impacts of big data on the knowledge, activities and organisation of intelligence agencies is challenging some foundational intelligence principles, including the distinction between foreign and domestic intelligence collection. Furthermore, the book argues that big data has created emerging threats to national security; for example, it enables invasive targeting and surveillance, drives information warfare as well as social and political interference, and challenges the existing models of harm assessment used in national security. The book maps broad areas of change for intelligence agencies in the national security context and what they mean for intelligence communities, and explores how intelligence agencies look out to the rest of society, considering specific impacts relating to privacy, ethics and trust.

The work focuses on the 1949 case of ITT in Hungary, where two of its executives, the American Robert A. Vogeler and the Briton Edgar Sanders, were arrested by the secret police, tortured, forced to confess, put on a public show trial, and found guilty of espionage.  This happened at a time that the US and the UK were cooperating in numerous operations to undermine the credibility of the communist regime and to encourage local resistance by “all means short of war.” Using the case as a lens to examine the dynamics of the early Cold War, the book integrates business history, diplomatic history and intelligence history, and thereby traces the impact of the case on Anglo-Hungarian, American-Hungarian, and Anglo-American relations during the critical period of 1949-1956.  Vogeler’s case had a strong impact on the growing criticism of the Truman Administration’s containment policies and contributed to the demand for a more activist policy of ‘liberation of captive peoples’.  His experiences also rallied the business community, especially trade associations such as the National Foreign Trade Council, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers, to support the anti-communist crusade both abroad and at home. Vogeler’s wife also waged a personal campaign to secure her husband’s release and exemplifies the activism of conservative and Catholic women who waged their own anti-communist crusade.  The book thus tells the “rest of the story” often omitted in traditional works.

As Michael Howard, Christopher Andrew and others acknowledge, the double-agent networks were crucial in disseminating disinformation to the enemy, including in the run-up to D-Day.

The dominant approach has been to develop structured analytic techniques (SATs), teach them to analysts in brief training sessions, provide the means to use SATs on the job, and hope they work. The SAT approach, however, suffers from severe conceptual problems and a paucity of support from scientific research. For example, a highly promoted SAT—the analysis of competing hypotheses—was shown in several recent studies to either not improve judgment quality or to make it worse. This article recaps the key problems with the SAT approach and sketches some alternative interventions. At the core of these proposals is the idea that intelligence agencies should be focused broadly on improving intelligence and not narrowly on minimizing bias. While the latter contributes to achieving the former, overemphasis on bias minimization could inadvertently bias agencies toward a singular form of intervention, blinding then from potentially more effective interventions. Two lines of alternative intervention are sketched. The first line focuses on postanalytic statistical optimization methods such as recalibration and performance-weighted aggregation of analysts’ judgments. The second line focuses on a broad human augmentation program to optimize human cognition through better sleep, exercise, nutrition (including nootropic compounds), and biometric tracking.

Absent a practical way to verify compromises, NATO officials had little recourse but to assume that Moscow possessed all classified information exposed to spies.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/TLZEKJKY,2023-08-29,William T.

In this, Baer attempts to disentangle his own theory from the ongoing spy cases that ran roughly concurrently in this timeframe: CIA officers Rick Ames and Edward Lee Howard as well as FBI Special Agent Robert Hanssen. The examination of all the flaws of Baer’s own argument and evidence along with comparisons with more authoritative eyewitness testimony reveals a narrative that is needlessly and dangerously gratuitous, since it fails to make even a prima facie case regarding the reputation of its target. In the end, these flaws and fallacies illustrate so much that passes for “professional” analysis in this day and age.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HBCG37YM,2023-04-03,W.

The event was recently depicted in the Steven Spielberg movie Bridge of Spies. Powers was captured by the KGB, subjected to a televised show trial, and imprisoned, all of which created an international incident. Soviet authorities eventually released him in exchange for captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. On his return to the United States, Powers was exonerated of any wrongdoing while imprisoned in Russia, yet, due to bad press and the government's unwillingness to heartily defend Powers, a cloud of controversy lingered until his untimely death in 1977. Now his son, Francis Gary Powers Jr. and acclaimed historian Keith Dunnavant have written this new account of Powers's life based on personal files that had never been previously available. Delving into old audio tapes, letters his father wrote and received while imprisoned in the Soviet Union, the transcript of his father's debriefing by the CIA, other recently declassified documents about the U-2 program, and interviews with the spy pilot's contemporaries, Powers and Dunnavant set the record straight.

Existing historical works have noted MI5's concern over the links between Indian nationalists and the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) during the inter-war period. Absent from the current historiography, however, is an account of the British government's response to V. K. Krishna Menon's appointment as India's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1947. This article examines the nature of Menon's relationship with the CPGB, the risk that communists working for him within India's High Commission posed to British security, and the strategy that MI5 developed to meet it. Taken as a whole, as this article illustrates, the Attlee government's conviction that India, and more particularly, Krishna Menon, represented a weak link in the Commonwealth security chain, opens up new perspectives on Anglo-Indian relations post-1947.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/8LCDL652,2010-09-01,Paul M.

984,“Quiet Americans in India”: The CIA and the Politics of Intelligence in Cold War South Asia*1,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1093/dh/dht131,"In February 1967, officials from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were horrified when the American west-coast magazine, Ramparts, exposed the U.S. intelligence organization's longstanding financial relationships with a number of international educational institutions and cultural bodies. In a series of articles, reproduced in The New York Times and The Washington Post, Ramparts documented the CIA's provision of covert funding to, among others, the National Students Association, Asia Foundation, and Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF). In India, an outpouring of public indignation ensued when it became clear that the Indian Committee for Cultural Freedom, a local offshoot of the CCF, had accepted money from the CIA. The global spotlight cast upon some of the CIA's more questionable activities had a profound and enduring impact upon Indian perceptions of the United States' government and its external intelligence service. In the wake of the Ramparts scandal, the CIA came to occupy a prominent place in IndoU.S. cultural and political discourse. For the remainder of the twentieth century, and beyond, anti-American elements inside and outside India drew repeatedly upon the specter of CIA subversion as a means of undermining New Delhi s relationship with Washington.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IIXJ4VUT,2014-11-01,Paul Michael McGarr,,Diplomatic History,2024-01-19T14:33:03Z,['CZT6L9T7']

Arguing that the CIA represented an historical anachronism that had outlived its usefulness to American foreign policy-makers, Moynihan proposed that the Agency should be stripped of its autonomy and have its intelligence functions subsumed by the Department of State. Moynihan's rhetorical assault on the CIA marked the opening salvo in a protracted campaign that, over the following decade, until his death in March 2003, would see the one-time member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence lobby relentlessly for reform of America's intelligence community and against pervasive official secrecy. To date, Moynihan's evangelical fervour in championing a more open intelligence paradigm, which came to incorporate the drafting of congressional bills, the chairmanship of a bipartisan commission on government secrecy, the publication of a book, and innumerable speeches and articles, has been interpreted in a narrow personal and political context. Commentators have tended to characterize Moynihan's turn against the CIA, and towards government transparency as symptomatic of individual eccentricity, disenchantment with purported Agency excesses during the Reagan administration, and ill-judged post-Cold War hubris. This article breaks new ground by reframing and reperiodizing Moynihan's relationship with intelligence. It suggests that Moynihan's attitudes to intelligence and state secrecy were formulated much earlier than has hitherto been acknowledged, and in an environment far removed from Washington's corridors of power. Specifically, the essay relocates Moynihan's emergence as an advocate of intelligence reform in the global political turmoil of the early 1970s when, as Richard Nixon's ambassador to India, he was afforded ample scope to assess the CIA's utility as an instrument of American diplomacy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PS88JJDM,2015-03-27,Paul McGarr,,History,2024-01-19T14:32:26Z,['HCN8YFI8']

It recovers the importance of nonaligned nations in the story of Cold War covert propaganda. Over the course of a decade, that began with the outbreak of the Sino-Indian border war in 1962, and culminated in the Indo-Pakistan conflict of 1971, India disengaged from the West, and tilted towards the Eastern bloc. In the process, New Delhi struggled to control diplomatic fallout from a covert propaganda conflict waged on its territory between the Soviet Union and the United States that, at times, threatened to imperil a strategic reorientation in India’s foreign policy. This article privileges the significance of hitherto neglected actors in the history of a secret Cold War episode in the subcontinent. India evidenced a concerned, if not always productive response to political warfare operations conducted by foreign powers inside its borders. Disquiet over the damage that the dissemination of disinformation and, in particular, the publication of forged documents smearing national governments could do to its relationships with international partners, ensured that India was never a passive player in the propaganda Cold War.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/STGZF8HQ,2021-01-02,Paul M.

Although these oversight bodies have wide jurisdiction and strong investigative powers, their effectiveness is limited by the broad statutory powers granted to intelligence agencies and by the reluctance of successive governments to accept their recommendations for change.

It draws attention to the number and range of oversight bodies, but also identifies their inefficiencies and flaws, including their fragmented coverage and their emphasis on legal compliance rather than broader notions of accountability. The chapter notes that, in the absence of broader approaches to accountability, civil society campaigns against surveillance have filled the gap. Yet, although civil society interventions are important, they cannot take the role of rigorous official governmental review bodies. The chapter reflects on potential legal and institutional reforms to implement stronger independent oversight in the U.K.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IBS4P3US,2016-06-01,"Jon Moran, Clive Walker",Oxford University Press,,2024-01-18T19:15:55Z,['DVEM4H4W']

First, it discusses operations of the G10 Commission, which has a distinctive nonjudicial and non-parliamentary role. By examining the limited information known about the commission’s secret proceedings, including the speed with which it approves orders, its high rate of approval, and the limited personnel and expertise at work, the chapter concludes that it is not providing effective oversight. Second, the chapter argues that although the G10 Commission was ruled constitutional in 1970, both the facts of the case at the time and recent developments have undermined the assessment of its constitutionality",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/TWJ9R4DA,2016-06-01,Russell A.

This chapter focuses on another sense of intelligence oversight, distinguished by its concern with promoting effective intelligence collection while seeking to minimize a wide range of costs, including diplomatic blowback, economic harm to American firms, and intrusiveness that threatens privacy rights. It argues that the institution that has begun to furnish this more holistic sort of oversight, and that enjoys conspicuous advantages over preexisting bodies in doing so, is the president, aided by his staff (especially the NSC). This chapter offers a descriptive account of the rise of presidential intelligence (emphasizing the roles of technology firms and American allies), a qualified normative defense of its value (in addition to, rather than instead of, existing oversight bodies), and a set of prescriptions for how to design institutions to realize its full potential.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3JYP2NLU,2016-06-01,Samuel J.

The chapter argues that many of the most difficult questions facing oversight institutions require the analysis of a broad set of interests and concerns. Oversight institutions should act as proxies for the public, aiming to represent their interests in otherwise secret processes. The chapter demonstrates through a historical analysis of the development of oversight institutions in the United States that many of the current institutions of oversight were conceived with relatively narrow missions focused on compliance. The chapter demonstrates the relevance of governance questions to contemporary issues in intelligence oversight and argues for a set of adjustments to some existing independent oversight institutions so that they may embrace a broader role alongside institutions designed to ensure compliance with law.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/M872GAE8,2016-06-01,Zachary K.

These growing accountability gaps risk compromising human rights, national security, and Canada’s international stature. The gaps originate, in many respects, in Canada’s limited system of legislative review of intelligence activities that does not give legislators access to secret information. Canadian courts and public inquiries have partially have stepped into this voId. Although all three branches are necessary for intelligence oversight, executive watchdog review should play the most important part. The chapter concludes by proposing that Canada’s future oversight and review processes should expand the role of institutions such as the Security Intelligence Review Committee so that it has a whole of government mandate. The chapter also explores the possibility of transnational oversight structures.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/2MFAHJNK,2016-06-01,Kent Roach,Oxford University Press,,2024-01-18T19:13:19Z,"['DVEM4H4W', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Such reliance calls for an explanation, as among potential official oversight bodies, the courts seem most unsuitable for such oversight: it is reactive and case-oriented, and lacks resources of time and expertise. The chapter first assesses the procedural and doctrinal adaptations taken by the Israeli Supreme Court, resulting in its transformation into a de facto oversight body. It seeks to explain the paradox that Israeli politicians allow extensive judicial scrutiny of national security matters by not passing legislation to limit the jurisdiction of the court (despite their power to do so). It shows that the traditional explanations for judicial independence do not apply to the Israeli case; rather, the explanation lies in Israel’s perceived need to seek international legitimacy for its security activities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/TMPYK2TV,2016-06-01,Raphael Bitton,Oxford University Press,,2024-01-18T16:13:51Z,"['DVEM4H4W', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

After discussing the limited competence the EU has in matters of national security, it focuses in particular on the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), explaining that the ECtHR evaluates the compliance of member states’ national policy and laws with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Although the ECtHR is not a direct source of oversight, the chapter explains how it promotes more rigorous national intelligence oversight among European states. In particular, the chapter explores the ECtHR’s semiautonomous legal process, including the ECHR’s extraterritorial effect, its procedural restraints, its soft power, and the role of member-states in implementing judgments. It concludes that the ECtHR’s law is important for any discussion of European oversight, but that the main oversight activities should still, as they do now, take place on a national level.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6YGUSDDK,2016-06-01,Iain Cameron,Oxford University Press,,2024-01-18T16:13:13Z,"['DVEM4H4W', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

The chapter proposes ways that the IC might respond to these trendsemphasizing the likelihood that the IC will rely more on open source information..

It argues specifically that the allied countries have structured and organized their intelligence services in similar ways, and regulated them with similar oversight mechanisms, outlining a theory of institutional convergence that explains this phenomenon. Four main processes gave rise to this phenomenon: competition, coercion, normative persuasion, and acculturation.

Peer constraints are an important component of an increasingly thick transnational legal ecosystem that constrains intelligence services. Peer constraints describe the limitations imposed on an intelligence service in excess of those imposed by the intelligence service’s own laws, which arise because of the need for cooperation to mitigate common threats. Through various mechanisms—formal and informal, public and private—one state’s intelligence service affects how a peer service conducts interrogation, detention, and surveillance; the amount and type of intelligence the other service receives; and, less tangibly, the way in which the other service views its own legal obligations. These constraints complement the more public, transparent, and expected sources of oversight and offer unique benefits, including a granular understanding of operations and ability to minimize the politicization that frequently accompanies intelligence critiques. Because of leaks, litigation, and a growing volume of domestic laws and regulations, peer constraints are leading Western democracies towards more rights-protective intelligence practices.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/AI2Q9JLM,2016-06-01,Ashley Deeks,Oxford University Press,,2024-01-18T16:10:19Z,['DVEM4H4W']
1010,Global Intelligence Oversight: Governing Security in the Twenty-First Century,Book,https://academic.oup.com/book/4147,"In a world that is increasingly unstable, intelligence services such as the American CIA, the U.K.’s Secret Intelligence Service, and Israel’s Mossad exist to deliver security and stability. Whether the challenge involves terrorism, cybersecurity, or the renewed specter of great power conflict, intelligence agencies mitigate threats and provide decisional advantage to national security leaders. But empowered intelligence services require adequate supervision and oversight, which must be about more than the narrow (if still precarious) task of ensuring the legality of covert operations and surveillance activities. This book is a comparative investigation of how democratic countries can govern their intelligence services so that they are effective, but operate within frameworks that are acceptable to their people in a complex and interconnected world. The book demonstrates how the institutions that oversee intelligence agencies participate in the protection of national security while safeguarding privacy and civil liberties, balancing among competing national interests, and building public trust in inherently secret activities. It does so by analyzing the role of organizations such as courts and independent oversight bodies as they operate in countries with both robust frameworks of constitutional law and powerful intelligence services. The volume also illuminates the ways in which new forces, such as global technology companies and courts whose jurisdiction crosses national boundaries, play an important role in intelligence oversight. As rapid changes in technology bring the world increasingly closer together, these forces will complement their more traditional counterparts in ensuring that intelligence activities remain effective, legitimate, and sustainable.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GJUM4YF5,2016-05-19,"Zachary K.

Among the justifications for this are the transformation of the security situation and the development of asymmetric war and terrorism, instead of the previous justification of ‘bipolarity’. Analysts call for a necessary adaptation to this new situation by obliging intelligence services to collaborate between themselves in order to get a global reach, to develop sophisticated technologies of surveillance, to use them as much as possible to collect the traces left by individuals or groups on the Internet, to have more personnel or to contract private companies to exploit the mass of information, and to push towards the use of artificial intelligence. This has created a huge extension (some would say a colonisation) of other social spaces by professionals of secret services and their collaborators. Private partners, Internet users, privacy analysts, international lawyers, and others who until recently have been unaware of the old ‘spy’ activities, have also entered, sometimes against their will, as ‘amateurs’ in this social space.

It argues that this gravitational shift from watching to modification makes the subject more steered than disciplined, putting its agency at even greater risk. Moreover, it ventures that more than putting the subject's agency at greater risk, this move also reconfigures the very meaning of agency in the context of surveillance and intelligence, by impelling us to understand it in temporal terms, as the capacity to move freely in time, instead of in spatial terms, as a mere extension of privacy.

Citizens of a state can claim the right to privacy within their own state territory, but not foreigners or citizens abroad. However, there have been various initiatives at the international, regional, and national levels to unsettle this distinction and to enact boundaries to intelligence agencies, codifying the Internet user as an international legal subject. This chapter introduces socio-legal approaches to the study of intelligence by focusing on the Internet through a human rights lens. What is at stake for state territoriality and intelligence agencies’ legitimation of their activities when Internet users claim human rights universally?

Specifically, by drawing on legal texts and relevant parts of the Snowden files, it shows how FRA have greatly expanded their secret data collection capacities as well as intensified their intelligence exchanges with the USA to the extent that the National Security Agency (NSA) considers Sweden one of its ‘most valued foreign partners' today. A country where public trust in security authorities is generally high, Sweden's involvement in transnational mass surveillance and counter-terrorism practices has been left unscrutinised and partly unregulated for many years.

Seeking to help remedy both shortcomings, this chapter aims at the politico-social character of New Zealand's intelligence community and the routine interactions among New Zealand intelligence professionals and their foreign counterparts that tend to promote bureaucratic amity ahead of New Zealand's national interest. It interrogates the intelligence community's recently formed partnerships with commercial enterprises operating within New Zealand's economy, including private security companies, telecommunications providers, and so-called firms of national significance, which drastically increase intelligence actors’ ability to surveil the daily lives of New Zealanders to an unprecedented, and quite possibly unwarranted, degree. Progressed under the auspices of cybersecurity, but lent urgency as potential counter-terrorism measures, these everyday practices of intelligence work occur in the shadows of more public, though episodic, debate over the meaning of ‘national security’.

The chapter aims to provide a better understanding of the ‘manufacture of intelligence’ by examining in detail the tools, habits, and practices of police forces and intelligence services in Germany.

Based on several months of ethnographic observations, it investigates the practices of detecting and evaluating ‘radicalisation’ in French prisons. In prisons, units have been created to group together ‘Islamist terrorist’ detainees for assessment by a series of professionals for four-month periods to decide on their future prison management and their prison assignments. These units represent a new form of prison intelligence services. Prison intelligence services are very powerful and have a significant weight in the selection, assignment, and orientation of so-called ‘radicalised prisoners’. This begs the question whether the central objective of the prison is to neutralise, evaluate, or de-radicalise, or to provide information to intelligence services. Prisons, it seems, have become sites for professional participation in a mission of public utility: the prevention of violent acts and terrorist projects through the collection of information held and shared within a dissident group in detention. Indeed, the prison guards’ participation in intelligence objectives is regularly presented and praised as a ‘war effort’ by the staff.

What are its contemporary practical, human, and everyday dimensions? This introduction presents the book's aims and the analytical approach which will guide its chapter contributions towards answering these questions. First, through a series of examples, it is shown how intelligence practice has undergone several social, political, and technical transformations in recent years. No longer is intelligence mainly about espionage and state secrets. Today, it has multiplied and diversified to involve everything from digital mass surveillance to everyday policing and counter-terrorism operations. Second, the chapter argues that in order to study the transversal characteristics of modern intelligence, our analytical strategy needs to be similarly transdisciplinary. It shows how several key insights have been generated in fields such as criminology, critical security studies, political sociology, and surveillance studies, while insisting that these different investigations need to be better connected and engaged in cross-disciplinary dialogue. Finally, the chapter critiques how conventional Intelligence Studies (IS) have tended to define intelligence as a state-centric and functionalist phenomenon and argues that this leaves IS insufficiently geared towards studying the social, practical, and everyday dimensions of contemporary intelligence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GGSZGE6R,2022,"Hager Ben Jaffel, Sebastian Larsson",Routledge,,2024-01-18T10:32:09Z,['HCN8YFI8']

From 1942 to 1973, John Starnes was engaged in such areas as communications intelligence and, during his tenure as the first civilian director-general of the RCMP Security Service, in counter-espionage and counter-subversion. His recollection of these confidential activities and the part he played in them is supported by a wealth of formerly classified official documentation recently released under the Access to Information Act.

This is a highly personal narrative, brought vividly to life with excerpts from the letters that Starnes wrote home from London during the Second World War, when he moved in intelligence circles and met many prominent diplomats and policy-makers. His story recalls several of the key political moments of this century, including the creation of the United Nations, the glory days of External Affairs, the Six Day War between Israel and Egypt, and the October Crisis in 1970.

Starnes's memoir offers a fascinating look at Canada's security and intelligence work from the point of view of an official deeply involved in many covert government activities. It provides an insider's perspective on both the little-known world of the Canadian intelligence community and the international security and intelligence network in which Canada has participated. Written by the author of five spy novels, it will interest those who follow the history of Canada's undercover operations.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/H75A2KSL,1998-01-01,John Starnes,University of Toronto Press,,2024-01-18T10:17:01Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

This article assesses whether or not the new service is likely to be more effective than its predecessor and yet engender fewer fears that it might itself undermine what it seeks to defend. After briefly discussing the problems and events that led to the creation of the new service the article analyses the structural and legal changes that have taken place. The new instruments by which the CSIS is held accountable, such as the ofice of the Inspector General and the Security Intelligence Review Committee, are then examined followed by an analysis of the changes in the political ethos both within and without the CSIS. The article concludes by arguing that the new agency is likely to be both a more effective intelligence agency and a more responsible and responsive one. Sommaire: En 1984, le Service canadien de renseignements d'intelligence (SCRI) a remplacé le Service de sécurité de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada. Dans cet article, on examine la probabilité que le nouveau service soit plus eficace que son précurseur tout en réduisant les inquiétudes de ceux qui craignent qu'il ne détruise précisément ce qu'il est censé défendre. Après un bref exposé des problèmes et des événements qui ont amené l'établissement du nouveau senice, l'article analyse l'évolution structurelle et juridique qui a eu lieu. De nouveaux instruments qui assurent l'imputabilité du SCRI, comme le bureau de l'Inspecteur général et le Comité de surveillance des activités de renseignements de sécurité font alors l'objet d'examen; suit une analyse de l'évolution de la pensée politique à l'interieur comme à l'extérieur du SCRI.

The intelligence studies literature does not much explore such examples of intelligence cooperation let alone provide much basis for theorizing.

One was the underlying Canadian concern with intelligence on a variety of threatened frontiers, especially after 1945 with the remote northern flank. Another unique feature of Canadian history was the response to the lessons of the Second World War. Rather than consolidating the wartime intelligence community to serve postwar needs, Canada restricted itself to subordinate partnership in an intelligence alliance with the United States and the United Kingdom, forfeited a strategic intelligence capability, and concentrated on domestic security problems.

It is also, as the popularity of spy stories suggests, one of the most intriguing. This book pulls the veil back on the real world of espionage, revealing how spying actually works. In a refreshingly clear, concise manner, Kristie Macrakis guides readers through the shadowy world of espionage, from the language and practice of spycraft to its role in international politics, its bureaucratic underpinnings, and its transformation in light of modern technology. Espionage is a mirror of society and human foibles with the added cloak of secrecy and deception. Accordingly, Espionage traces spying all the way back to antiquity, while also moving beyond traditional accounts of military and diplomatic intelligence to shine a light on industrial espionage and the new techno-spy.

1042,Japanese Foreign Intelligence and Grand Strategy: From the Cold War to the Abe Era,Book,http://press.georgetown.edu/Book/Japanese-Foreign-Intelligence-and-Grand-Strategy-1,"Incisive insights into the distinctive nature of Japanese foreign intelligence and grand strategy, its underlying norms, and how they have changed over time

Japanese foreign intelligence is an outlier in many ways. Unlike many states, Japan does not possess a centralized foreign intelligence agency that dispatches agents abroad to engage in espionage. Japan is also notable for civilian control over key capabilities in human and signals intelligence. Japanese Foreign Intelligence and Grand Strategy probes the unique makeup of Japan's foreign intelligence institutions, practices, and capabilities across the economic, political, and military domains and shows how they have changed over time.

Brad Williams begins by exploring how Japan’s experiences of the Second World War and its new role as a major US ally influenced its adoption of bilateralism, developmentalism, technonationalism, and antimilitarism as key norms. As a result, Japanese intelligence-gathering resources centered primarily around improving its position in the global economy throughout the Cold War. Williams then brings his analysis up to the Abe Era, examining how shifts in the international, regional, and domestic policy environments in the twenty-first century have caused a gradual reassessment of national security strategy under former prime minister Shinzo Abe. As Japan reevaluates its old norms in light of regional security challenges, the book concludes by detailing how the country is beginning to rethink the size, shape, and purpose of its intelligence community.

Anyone interested in Japanese intelligence, security, or international relations will welcome this important contribution to our understanding of the country's intelligence capabilities and strategy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/C69SRCN3,2021-03-01,Brad Williams,Georgetown University Press,,2024-01-17T11:35:32Z,"['D67KFVND', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

British models were more important in the first quarter century after WW11. Subsequently, reflecting the greater importance of the US as a security partner (including through joint intelligence facilities on Australian soil), Australia has moved closer to American practice in refining the estimates machinery and in making it directly responsible to the head of government. Nevertheless Australian experience has had its own distinctive characteristics which make comparisons useful, especially in regard to receptivity and bureaucratic politics.

This is especially true in the case of smaller states, such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, this architecture is fundamentally important to our understanding of how the secret state operates; how it impacts, and is impacted by, the open state; and, when taken comparatively, is indicative of differing government cultures towards intelligence. Examination of the development of intelligence community management architecture in Australia, Canada and New Zealand reveals that actors in all three communities recognise networks of interdependency between them.

This frequently validates enhanced coordination among disparate security agencies, which in turn requires enhanced mass population surveillance and the increased circulation of information about citizen activity with fewer legal constraints.

1056,"Secret State, Transparent Subject: The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in the Age of Terror",Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1375/acri.38.3.400,"This article describes the secrecy provisions embodied in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment Act 2003 (Cwlth). The article explains how these provisions curb freedom of speech and remove ASIO's activities from the domain of public scrutiny. It argues that by effectively criminalising open discussion of ASIO's activities the provisions insulate much of the domestic ‘war on terror’ from the public gaze. It also argues that the provisions implicitly sanction lawlessness by ASIO in open breach of the rule of law.

The discovery that Anglo-Polish intelligence possessed at least two penetration agents within the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht and Oberkommando des Heeres, ‘Warlock’ and ‘Knopf ’, not only challenges this idée fixe, but corrects the historical record by overturning sixty years’ worth of received wisdom on the subject.

After WWII, he chose to stay abroad (in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States), where he continued to analyze Soviet affairs, publishing under the pen name of Ryszard Wraga.

1067,"British Intelligence and Turkish Arabia: Strategy, Diplomacy, and Empire, 1898-1918",Thesis,https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/32729,"This dissertation addresses early British intelligence activities and Anglo-Ottoman relations by viewing the activities of army officers and private individuals as a collective pursuit to safeguard British imperial interests. It offers a new understanding of the relationships between intelligence, grand strategy, and diplomacy before the Great War. It also examines the role that pre-1914 intelligence played in that conflict. 
The Boer War had shown that the geographic expanse of the British Empire was a source of strategic danger as well as a foundation of global power. The revelation of weakness propelled Britain to begin collecting intelligence on possible sources of conflict in preparation for the next war. 
A 1906 border incident between Egypt and Turkey marked turning points in Anglo-Ottoman relations and British intelligence efforts. Intelligence began to focus on railways that threatened Britain’s commercial position, on the disposition of Arab tribes who might revolt against Turkish authority, on the state of the Turkish army, and on the extent of European activity in Turkey.  
In 1914, British policy in the Middle East was unco-ordinated. Needing an effective means of combatting the Turco-German Jihad proclaimed in 1915, London created the Arab Bureau as an advisory organ based in Cairo. It became the central repository for much of the intelligence gathered before 1914. Officials in Cairo and London created new maps, compiled route reports, and assembled intelligence handbooks for distribution. Once the Arab Revolt began in 1916, intelligence helped marshal Britain’s resources effectively in pursuit of victory. 
Placing pre-1914 intelligence in the context of British imperial concerns extends our understanding of Anglo-Ottoman relations by considering strategic and diplomatic issues within a single frame. It demonstrates the influence of the Boer War in initiating intelligence-gathering missions in the Ottoman Empire, showing that even those undertaken before the establishment of a professional intelligence service in 1909, although lacking organization, were surprisingly modern, and ultimately successful.  
Analysis of under-utilized sources, such as the handbooks created by the Arab Bureau and the Royal Geographical Society, demonstrates the value of pre-war intelligence in detailed ways. It deepens understanding of the role British intelligence played in the defeat of the Ottoman Empire and shows how one nation’s intelligence, military, and diplomatic bodies operated separately and collectively in an era that presented them with unprecedented challenges and opportunities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/JK6QRCKL,2012-08-21,Geoffrey Hamm,,,2024-01-16T20:12:39Z,['9DTPTK46']

1070,Grand Ducal ambitions and Venetian counter-intelligence. The Tuscan failure in the 1607 attack on Cyprus.,Journal article,https://revistas.uam.es/historiaautonoma/article/view/12139,"In June 1607, a Tuscan fleet of about twenty ships and two thousand two hundred men attacked the fortress of Famagusta in Cyprus, with the aim of making it the base for the subsequent occupation of the whole island, which had been in Ottoman hands since 1570. The attack was a total failure: the Tuscan fleet, divided into two parts, did not meet as planned and the Greek inhabitants of the island, who according to Tuscan information should have rebelled, did not. Moreover, the Ottoman garrison was aware of the attack, which meant that the attempt at a surprise attack was in vain. It is clear that, excluding the logistical problem of the fleet meeting up, the enterprise’s lack of success was due to a total inadequacy of what we today would call “intelligence”. The information in Tuscans’ hands did not turn out to be completely correct and they were unable to keep the planned operation secret. However, by contrast, the Venetian intelligence was able to manage the information in its possession in a more cautious way, taking advantage of the situation effectively.
Through this case study, the article aims to follow the scholarship on information-gathering in the Early Modern Mediterranean world, showing, once again, how important and extensive such networks were. The aim of this short study, which is based largely on archival documentation, is not to deal with the Tuscan raid on the island, but to identify the faults of the Tuscan “intelligence” that led to the misfortunate attack. Moreover, through the analysis of the documents, it is also possible to add some elements to the knowledge about the Tuscan Grand Duke’s Levantine network.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/W73RHHCR,2021-03-31,Trentacoste Davide,,Revista Historia Autónoma,2024-01-16T20:00:32Z,"['DS3WDJUS', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

He is reported to have investigated Persian plans through the agency of spies (speculatores), from whom he and an associate learned (aperte cognossent) that the Persian king Shapur II was currently engaged in fierce fighting with hostile peoples on a distant frontier of his empire. On the basis of this information Musonianus initiated secret negotiations with a Persian official, in the hope that these difficulties would incline the Persians towards a formal peace settlement with the Romans and put an end to the costly but inconclusive warfare of the previous two decades (xvi.9.2-3).In the event, Musonianus' diplomatic initiative proved not only abortive, but positively counter-productive, leading on to the second episode. The Persians concluded from Musonianus' initiative that the Romans themselves were in difficulties, and since Shapur had been able, by early 358, to bring his own war to an end, he decided in turn to try to exploit Roman problems and sent envoys to demand territorial concessions as the price for peace.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/JVCX89MG,1993,A.

I evaluate three competing explanations drawn from the level of international politics, focusing on US power resources and influence as well as liberal and constructivist styles of analysis—alliance politics, sectionalism, and the norm of antimilitarism—in order to shed light on the historical origins of Japan's intelligence apparatus, which is relatively underdeveloped and underfunded compared to other middle powers. It highlights the primacy of domestic factors over structural causes in explaining the decision not to establish a JCIA. In particular, I argue that the JCIA proposal failed primarily because of attacks on important proponents that, while sometimes driven by seemingly rational organizational interests, were nevertheless legitimated by growing antimilitaristic sentiments shared by elites from the political center to the left of the ideological spectrum. The newly emerging norm of antimilitarism was predicated largely on a fear of constraints on recently acquired civil and political liberties. These fears, manifested most prominently in vocal Diet and media opposition, were compounded by the norm of secrecy—an important element of intelligence activities—which served to heighten further speculation about the malign intent of postwar Japan's reconstituted intelligence system.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ERFTFBW7,2013-04-01,Brad Williams,,Journal of East Asian Studies,2024-01-16T12:33:56Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

However, Japan has been progressively getting out of this low-key stance in the area of national intelligence. This article argues that, among various international developments, the most obvious and immediate momentum for the improvement in Japan's national intelligence has come from a series of security events caused by North Korea, such as: the first and second nuclear crisis respectively in 1993–94 and 2002–present; the test-firing of the Nodong-1 ballistic missile in 1993 and the launching of the Taepodong-1 rocket in 1998; alleged spy ship incidents in 1999 and 2001; and the long suspected North Korean kidnapping of Japanese citizens and Pyongyang's admission to it in 2002. The article goes on to answer the following questions: how has Japan's national intelligence responded and what efforts has Japan made to upgrade intelligence capability in the face of North Korea-related security concerns? And what are the next steps Japan could take for progressive improvement of intelligence capability?",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XSRGT9ZU,2004-01-01,Sung-jae Choi,,The Pacific Review,2024-01-16T12:21:48Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

Richard J. Aldrich makes extensive use of recently declassified files in order to examine the politics of secret service during the Far Eastern War, analysing the development of organizations such as Bletchley Park, the Special Operations Executive and the Office of Strategic Services in Asia. He argues that, from the Battle of Midway in June 1942, the Allies focused increasingly on each other's future ambitions, rather than the common enemy. Central to this theme are Churchill, Roosevelt and their rivalry over the future of empire in Asia. Richard J.

It is based on extensive engagement with more than 50 experts across government, academia, industry, and civil society, and represents the most comprehensive UK-based study to date on the national security implications of generative AI. The research found that generative AI could significantly amplify a range of digital, physical and political security risks. With the rapid proliferation of generative AI tools across the economy, the national security community needs to shift its mindset to account for all the unintentional or incidental ways in which generative AI can pose security risks, in addition to intentionally malicious uses. The report provides recommendations to effectively mitigate the security risks posed by generative AI, calling for a new multi-layered, socio-technical approach to system evaluation.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/68547F7U,2023-12-01,"Ardi Janjeva, Alexander Harris, Sarah Mercer, Alexander Kasprzyk, Anna Gausen",,,2024-01-15T19:02:36Z,['E5UVWK8S']

This shift of human activities from offline to online spaces has major impacts for national security. Consequently, cyberspace became a new field of operation for intelligence and counter-intelligence services worldwide. While massive efforts are made to further strategies based on surveys and analyses of large datasets, cybersecurity protocols can be impacted tremendously by individual behaviors. This is particularly the case of online sexual behavior, which can be easily manipulated by malevolent agents. This paper will describe some of the general characteristics of sexual cyberbehaviors. We will then identify some of the main threats related to sexual cyberbehavior (specifically risks of blackmailing, risks associated with the use of online dating sites, and risks associated with the consumption of online pornography), as well as the main targets in terms of population from an intelligence/counter-intelligence perspective. Finally, we will propose some possible counter-measures, that could be implemented to reduce the security risks related to online sexual behavior.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/M3LYZAU8,2019-05-04,Matthieu J.

Apart from the dozen or so defendants convicted of spying, Gouzenko wrecked an organization that had taken years to develop, exposed the penetration of the Manhattan atomic weapons project, and demonstrated the very close relationship between the Canadian Communist Party and Moscow. Many credit this event as sparking the bitter but secretive struggle fought between the intelligence agencies of the East and West for nearly half a century.

The Historical Dictionary of Cold War Counterintelligence tells the story of both sides' fierce efforts to penetrate and subvert the opponent while desperately trying to avoid a similar fate.

The study reviews the organization, doctrine, mission, and equipment of counterintelligence units to determine their impact on operations in the ETO, Germany. This study also reviews the same topics for counterintelligence operations prior to World War II to determine significant changes that may have affected operations in World War II. The study concludes that the decision to place counterintelligence assets with combat units from the division to theater level was the most significant decision of the war for US Army counterintelligence. The lack of a coherent doctrine, organization, and training program significantly reduced the ability of the Counter Intelligence Corps CIC to contribute to the war effort in the ETO prior to 1943. As the result of wartime experience and doctrine developed in 1943, the CIC became proactive, making significant contributions to counter the German Intelligence Service at both the operational and tactical levels. Based on these lesson learned, the study makes recommendations for the future of counterintelligence in the US Army as the 21st century approaches.

The pivot of the process was a contract for counter-intelligence services. The contract itself was partly written, partly verbal or implied, and highly incomplete. Before the contract, searching and due diligence were required to identify potential recruits. After the contract, to turn a recruit into a productive informer involved a further period of training and monitoring, often extending to renegotiation and further investments by both sides in the capabilities of the informer and the relationship of trust with the handler.

Some strategies work well, some fail, and those tasked with tracking these groups are deeply invested in the difference.Discussing the challenges terrorist groups face as they multiply and plot international attacks, while at the same time providing a framework for decoding the strengths and weaknesses of their counterintelligence, Blake W. Mobley provides an indispensable text for the intelligence, military, homeland security, and law enforcement fields. He outlines concrete steps for improving the monitoring, disruption, and elimination of terrorist cells, primarily by exploiting their mistakes in counterintelligence. A key component of Mobley's approach is to identify and keep close watch on areas that often exhibit weakness. While some counterintelligence pathologies occur more frequently among certain terrorist groups, destructive bureaucratic tendencies, such as mistrust and paranoia, pervade all organizations. Through detailed case studies, Mobley shows how to recognize and capitalize on these shortcomings within a group's organizational structure, popular support, and controlled territory, and he describes the tradeoffs terrorist leaders make to maintain cohesion and power. He ultimately shows that no group can achieve perfect secrecy while functioning effectively and that every adaptation or new advantage supposedly attained by these groups also produces new vulnerabilities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HCWWF458,2012-08-01,Blake W.

While Russian armies fought furiously to defeat the Wehrmacht, Stalin’s security services waged an equally ruthless secret war against Hitler’s spies, as well as against the Soviet population. For the first time, Robert Stephan now combines declassified U.S. intelligence documents, captured German records, and Russian sources, including a top-secret Soviet history of its intelligence and security services, to reveal the magnitude and scope of the brutal but sophisticated Soviet counterintelligence war against Nazi Germany.

Employing as many as 150,000 trained agents across a 2,400-mile front, the Soviets neutralized the majority of the more than 40,000 German agents deployed against them. As Stephan shows, their combination of Soviet military deception operations and State Security’s defeat of the Abwehr’s human intelligence effort had devastating consequences for the German Army in every major battle against the Red army, including Moscow, Stalingrad, Kursk, the Belorussian offensive, and the Vistula-Oder operation.

Simultaneously, Soviet State Security continued to penetrate the world’s major intelligence services including those of its allies, terrorize its own citizens to prevent spying, desertion, and real or perceived opposition to the regime, and run millions of informants, making the USSR a vast prison covering one sixth of the world’s surface.

Stephan discusses all facets of the Soviet counterintelligence effort, including the major Soviet “radio games” used to mislead the Germans—operations Monastery, Berezino, and those that defeated Himmler’s Operation Zeppelin. He also gives the most comprehensive account to date of the Abwehr’s infamous agent “Max,” whose organization allegedly ran an entire network of agents inside the USSR, and reveals the reasons for Germany’s catastrophic under-estimation of Soviet forces by more than one million men during their 1944 summer offensive in Belorussia

CIA historian Don Steury has written:

By contrast, “strategic counterintelligence” remains a relatively undeveloped concept, in theory or implementation. Isn’t this curious? For if strategic intelligence takes as its touchstone the whole of state interests and the sources of state power, then understanding the purpose and manner in which other states use their intelligence resources to gain advantage and mastering the capability to counter them would seem to be the other side of the strategic intelligence coin.

Yet to the extent strategic counterintelligence (CI) is addressed within CI or intelligence circles, it is controversial, poorly understood, and even more poorly executed because it does not fit comfortably within the existing architecture and approach to counterintelligence as it has developed within the United States.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YTW3DG3A,2007-06-01,Michelle K. van Cleave,,Studies in Intelligence,2024-01-15T17:40:43Z,['RHJFPRAI']

Edgar Hoover is studded with serious questions about the Bureau's professionalism and accountability. Revelations in the recent cases of Wen Ho Lee, Robert Hannsen, and Timothy McVeigh illustrate these misgivings. In Chasing Spies, Athan Theoharis, historian and perhaps the foremost authority on the FBI's record, raises urgent new uncertainties about the Bureau's behavior—and about the prospects for giving the FBI expanded powers of surveillance during the current national emergency. Mr. Theoharis here redefines the politics of the World War II and cold war eras, moving the debate beyond the narrow perspective triggered by the release of KGB records and intercepted Soviet consular reports (the Venona messages). The intriguing issue, he argues, is not the effectiveness of Soviet espionage activities as supported by the new evidence. Nor is it the long-standing charges of “softness toward communism” in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. The real issue, he says, is the failure of the FBI to apprehend and convict Soviet agents. Based on meticulous research in FBI files, Chasing Spies uncovers the FBI's role in the most important espionage cases of the cold war years. The book shows how secrecy immunized FBI operations from critical scrutiny and enabled FBI officials to mask their counterintelligence failures while promoting a politics of McCarthyism.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6FDPDI3C,2002-01-01,Athan Theoharis,Rowman & Littlefield,,2024-01-15T17:38:56Z,['CZT6L9T7']

The September 11, 2001 attacks by Al-Qaida against America highlight this fact but are not in themselves the reason counterintelligence should be reformed. Not surprisingly these attacks have stirred a general debate on how U.S. intelligence ought to be reformed to more adequately protect the nation. However, amidst these various discussions one aspect of American intelligence capabilities seems to be conspicuously absent counterintelligence. A review of counterintelligence functions and organization reveals that U.S. counterintelligence must be reformed organizationally. The current counterintelligence community structure hinders the effective employment of this crucial intelligence capability. In order to resolve this problem the author proposes a threefold approach to that reform 1 Centralize U.S. counterintelligence operations under a single agency that will have the authority to conduct both domestic and foreign operations, 2 leave the remaining offices of counterintelligence located throughout the federal government in place to provide investigative and analytical support to the central operations agency, and 3 devolve U.S. counterintelligence down to the state and local levels along with encouraging greater private sector participation in order to provide wider coverage of the threat that both spies and terrorists pose to U.S. national security.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5A929S8M,2003-09-01,Todd E.

1159,Terrorist group counterintelligence,Thesis,https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/553096,"Thesis (Ph.D.)--Georgetown University, 2008.; Includes bibliographical
      references. Most terrorist groups do not survive past their first few years of existence. All
      terrorist groups, even those that survive for decades, face a basic and constant existential
      threat: discovery of their activities, personnel, and plans by government law enforcement and
      intelligence agencies. Why do some terrorist groups manage this threat better than others?
      What accounts for the variation in terrorist group counterintelligence capabilities? Answers
      to these questions have profound implications for homeland security and international
      counterterrorism efforts.; The study examines how three core variables: a terrorist group's
      organizational structure, its access to controlled territory and its level of popular support,
      affect the terrorist group's counterintelligence strengths and vulnerabilities. Thirty-three
      terrorist groups are examined in a large typological framework while additional case studies
      provide an in-depth focus on Al Qaeda, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), Fatah,
      Black September, and the Egyptian Islamic Group (Gemaa al-Islamiyya).; The study shows that
      terrorist groups inevitably face predictable, though often subtle, counterintelligence
      dilemmas that challenge their ability to function effectively. Contrary to popular belief, the
      dissertation shows that hierarchical and tightly organized terrorist organizations are
      frequently superior to decentralized or 'network' terrorist organizations in their
      counterintelligence capabilities, and therefore are in many cases better suited for long-term
      survival. Additionally, the study shows that most terrorist group leaders crave publicity,
      which frequently undermines the terrorist group's need to maintain secrecy and security. This
      research offers numerous policy prescriptions for more efficiently exploiting terrorist
      counterintelligence vulnerabilities. Incorporating these insights into current
      counterterrorism efforts promises to add inventive methods for monitoring and eliminating
      terrorist groups.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GF4I9G7R,2008,Blake William Mobley,,,2024-01-15T13:48:34Z,"['RHJFPRAI', 'TLFN4NAL']"

The Jihādi version of analysis, however, is overshadowed by specific ideological motivators and justifications rooted in operational art.

Still, we can also observe how attempts are made to thoroughly understand an opponent’s weaknesses and strengths in tandem with ideological biases, without paying much attention to analytical craft. Intelligence analysts sometimes reach conclusions that turn out to be inaccurate, which is commonly referred to as “intelligence failure” or “post-mortem” and becomes a “lesson learned”.

Apart from the seaborne character, there was state sponsorship from Pakistan, nexus with organized criminal groups and communal objectives. The only difference was that the 2008 attacks were carried out with greater sophistry as a result of the right lessons learnt from 1993, and a greater involvement of the Pakistani ‘deep state’. The central question approached in this article is how does a nation cope with such a triad threat perception?

Democracies, while wary of these instruments, have benefited significantly from their use, saving lives, treasure, and gaining strategic advantage. As liberal democracies confront the post-Cold War mix of rogue states and non-state actors, such as criminals and terrorists, and weapons of mass destruction and mass disruption, these clandestine arts may prove to be important tools of statecraft, and perhaps trump cards in the twenty-first century.Godson defines covert action as influencing events in other parts of the world without attribution, and counterintelligence as identifying, neutralizing, and exploiting the secret activities of others. Together they provide the capability to resist manipulation and control others to advantage. Counterintelligence protects U.S. military, technological, and diplomatic secrets and turns adversary intelligence to U.S. advantage. Covert action enables the United States to weaken adversaries and to assist allies who may be hampered by open acknowledgment of foreign support.Drawing on contemporary and historical literature, broad-ranging contacts with senior intelligence officials in many countries, as well as his own research and experience as a longtime consultant to the U.S. government, Godson traces the history of U.S. covert action and counterintelligence since 1945, showing that covert action works well when it is part of a well-coordinated policy and when policy makers are committed to succeeding in the long-term. Godson argues that the best counterintelligence is an offensive defense. His exposition of the essential theoretical foundations of both covert action and counterintelligence, supported by historical examples, lays out the ideal conditions for their use, as well as demonstrating why they are so difficult to attain.This book will be of interest to students and general readers interested in political science, national security, foreign policy, and military policy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/EALHT9DF,2000,Roy Godson,Transaction Publishers,,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,['RHJFPRAI']

The functions that U.S. counterintelligence CI performs in the face of these changing intelligence threats have well-established tactical objectives and processes, but their potential as an integral part of American national security strategy is just starting to emerge. The work of clandestine services, engaged in intelligence collection and other activities, is an arena of international competition in which the advantage does not necessarily go to the rich or powerful. Foreign adversaries may not have a prayer of fielding costly and technologically demanding technical collection suites, but they can organize, train, equip, sustain, and deploy impressive numbers of case officers, agents of influence, saboteurs, and spies, and the United States has become the single most important collection target in the world.

Addressing the threat caused by such antagonists requires a fast and offensive Cyber Counterintelligence (CCI) process, and a more efficient inter-organizational information exchange. This paper proposes a framework for offensive CCI based on technical tools and techniques for data mining, anomaly detection, and extensive sharing of cyber threat data. The framework is placed within the distinct context of military intelligence, in order to achieve a holistic, offensive and target-centric view of future CCI. The main contributions offered are (i) a comprehensive process that bridges the gap between the various actors involved in CCI, (ii) an applied technical architecture to support detection and identification of data leaks emanating from cyber espionage, and (iii) deduced intelligence community requirements.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/MJ26TA22,2013-08,"Johan Sigholm, Martin Bang",,,2024-01-14T19:35:50Z,"['RHJFPRAI', '8XXD789V']"

In order to critically evaluate such claims, this article analyzes the case of United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO). Both the organization of the mission-related intelligence structures (G2, JMAC, and JOC) and their practices are brought to light by interviews with MONUSCO staff, a visit to mission’s headquarters in Goma, UN reports and documents, and specialized literature. The findings indicate that intelligence contributed to improve C2 at MONUSCO by playing a critical role at the tactical (neutralizing armed groups) and operational (sharing information and providing mission-wide situational awareness) levels.

Negative Intelligence traces the fascinating and astonishing story of military espionage on the home front.

Created by Major General Ralph H. Van Deman in 1917, the Negative Branch of Military, or MI, spied on American reformers in a program of civilian surveillance that surpassed even that of the Department of Justice's Bureau of Investigation. Among the targets were the Industrial Workers of the World, the American Civil Liberties Union, and “Negro Subversion. ” Documentation of MI's program of domestic espionage is from recently opened Military Intelligence archives.

Closely allied with private vigilante groups, the Army conducted illegal raids, made illegal arrests, subjected many citizens to interrogation, and developed an elaborate filing system for its dossiers. After World War I the hysteria continued, with MI's direct focus beamed upon a new enemy, the Bolsheviki.

Although MI's abuses have been overshadowed by those of the Department of Justice, army espionage was in many ways more aggressive than its civilian counterpart. Negative Intelligence documents these abuses and shows how until 1921 the attempts to restrain MI's work failed. After this time, with limited staff and funding MI could do no more than maintain close liaison with private super-patriotic groups. However, the coming of the Great Depression fired up the rebirth of the army's civilian espionage programs. Then as World War II approached, internal security once again became a national policy, and J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation moved his powerful network into the supreme position of domestic spying.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/NHWNUX7F,2008-10-01,Roy Talbert,University Press of Mississippi,,2024-01-14T19:09:00Z,"['BNPYHVD4', 'MP7FJ9UA', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

In the Palestine theater as elsewhere, the British and Dominion forces leveraged new technologies, including aerial photography and wireless intercepts, to supplement their use of intelligence to map enemy troop positions. The creation and distribution of these position maps by the 7th Field Survey Company for the Third Battle of Gaza in late 1917 represented an innovative process of intelligence-gathering, map production, and knowledge distribution. This paper not only examines the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) along with its subordinate intelligence assets and cartographic organizations as a comprehensive mapping system, but also elaborates upon David Woodward’s cartographic framework to study the creation of the 7th Field Survey Company’s position maps as well as their utility, accuracy, and effectiveness. Woodward’s framework divides the map production process into four phases: information gathering, information processing, document distribution, and document use. Elements of the EEF were involved in each of these phases during the Third Battle of Gaza. This mapping system was cyclical insofar as the operations that these maps helped to facilitate also gathered further information that fed into the next cycle’s product. As the condition of the battlefield and the nature of the operations changed, so too did the value of various modes of intelligence gathering, with varying effects on the accuracy and utility of the position maps. The utility of the position map technique is apparent in its reintroduction prior to the EEF’s final offensive in 1918.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/TBRGJYTI,2016,"Joel Radunzel, Elri Liebenberg, Imre Josef Demhardt, Soetkin Vervust",Springer International Publishing,,2024-01-14T19:02:19Z,['BNPYHVD4']

But for Bolshevik Russia, Great Britain - not America - was the enemy. Now, for the first time, Victor Madeira tells a story that has been hidden away for nearly a century. Drawing on over sixty Russian, British and French archival collections, Britannia and the Bear offers a compelling new narrative about how two great powers did battle, both openly and in the shadows.
By exploring British and Russian mind-sets of the time this book traces the links between wartime social unrest, growing trade unionism in the police and the military, and Moscow's subsequent infiltration of Whitehall. As earlyas 1920, Cabinet ministers were told that Bolshevik intelligence wanted to recruit university students from prominent families destined for government, professional and intellectual circles. Yet despite these early warnings, men such as the Cambridge Five slipped the security net fifteen years after the alarm was first raised.
Now in paperback, Britannia and the Bear tells the story of Russian espionage in Britain in these critical interwar years and reveals how British Government identified crucial lessons but failed to learn many of them.

This essay is finally intended to serve as both an opening to further research on specific subjects such as Jaussen, and as a call to develop new historiographical tactics when dealing with issues that connect European and Middle Eastern actors and structures.

Because their capture was at odds with a heroic representation of the Australian war experience in the post-war period, little has been written about their war in captivity. But historians who have written about captivity tend to dwell on the personal, subjective nature of captivity and rarely consider the benefit prisoners are to the armies that capture them. This study addresses both omissions, and looks at prisoners of war as intelligence sources through the experience of Australian troops captured by the German Army on the Western Front. This paper uses prisoner testimony and German intelligence records to demonstrate that most Australian prisoners were ‘sturdily determined’ not to reveal any information of value to the enemy, yet the German Army still managed to obtain ‘very important information’ from them. It looks at AIF counter-intelligence methods, German procedures for handling prisoners for intelligence purposes, interrogation methods, prisoner experiences, what the German Army learned from Australian prisoners, as well as examples of how the German Army used information obtained from prisoners. It also looks at two cases of Australian troops who willingly disclosed information about the AIF and its operations having deserted to the enemy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5XCB352Q,2013-10-01,Aaron Pegram,,First World War Studies,2024-01-14T18:46:31Z,['BNPYHVD4']

During his time at MI7b, Chalmers Mitchell produced an extensive report on German propaganda, intended to inform officials and propagandists of its content in order to assist Britain's own propaganda efforts. However, his attempt to provide an ‘objective and unbiased . . . presentation of facts’ was undermined by prejudice, complacency, presumption of expertise and the tailoring of discussion towards the tastes of his audience. The article explores Chalmers Mitchell's pre-war and wartime connections with and writing about Germany before assessing his report and briefly exploring possible connections between it and later British propaganda. It argues that, as a scientist, he was accustomed to producing ‘consensible’ knowledge capable of obtaining scholarly consensus because it followed established conventions. While he traded upon his scientific expertise in earlier public interventions about Germany, this was not highlighted in his report. Instead, because he was writing for officials and workers in a government department, his account was made consensible for its audience by confirming what they already thought. It thus discouraged rather than encouraging more complex British approaches to propaganda in the war's last years.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FKXQG9P8,2018,David Monger,,History,2024-01-14T17:26:08Z,['BNPYHVD4']

What was the relationship between intelligence agencies and the coercive instruments of imperial power? How far did intelligence-gathering help to maintain state authority? And what role did intelligence agencies play as architects of colonial state formation? These questions are discussed here with reference to two French overseas dependencies that proved especially turbulent in the 1920s: the Moroccan protectorate and the Syrian mandate. It will be suggested that colonial rule in these locations was so heavily dependent on intelligence-gathering that both could be termed ‘intelligence states’.,https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ELYLD5XT,2006-10-01,Martin Thomas,,Intelligence and National Security,2024-01-14T17:09:18Z,['MP7FJ9UA']

Apart from reviewing the main innovations and structures, and the means for information gathering, processing, dissemination and direction, the chapter identifies many challenges and summarizes these by means of three dichotomies. First, the European countries brought in the innovative intelligence capabilities, heavily based on advanced NATO procedures, but the main force was mostly populated with African soldiers who had the greater cultural familiarity and knew more of the locally spoken languages. Marrying the Western and African capabilities turned out to be challenging due to incoherent procedures, systems, levels of experience as well as reporting mechanisms. In addition, information-sharing from classified NATO databases proved difficult. Second, whereas several innovative intelligence units produced comprehensive intelligence reports focusing on the longer term, MINUSMA’s military leadership valued current and security-related intelligence more, but that was insufficiently available within the organization. Third, the contributions of military and civilian actors were largely stovepiped and lacked sufficient sharing, coordination and integration. The reasons underlying this were organizational, political as well as technical in nature.

This did not only go for Dutchbat, but for all intelligence services concerned. This cannot merely be explained by the fact that it was just shortly before the attack on the enclave that the Bosnian Serbs took the decision to conquer it completely, but it also has to do with the extremely weak intelligence position of the UN and with the absence of sufficient capacity and the right means to gather and analyse intelligence. Because of this, the fall of Srebrenica can be attributed to the failure of military intelligence. The Netherlands can be blamed as well. In the Dutch cabinet, in the Dutch Army and in Parliament an anti-intelligence attitude prevailed. Among them the idea had taken root that a peacekeeping operation did not require intelligence.

Experiences with hybrid opponents in recent conflicts have produced two innovations that effectively render the RIA debate superfluous. First, the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, and the follow-on Israeli operation against Hamas in 2008, revealed that an intelligence-led integrated approach is of paramount importance to effectively counter hybrid opponents.

The pace of events, the overload of real-time information and an increase in the number of actors—both state and non-state—that are able to present strategic challenges require a different approach both to intelligence and to the notion of strategic surprise.

Its territory was used as a springboard and a place for information exchange. Also, The Netherlands itself were the subject of military information gathering, as it was a potential area for military operations by each of the surrounding great powers. The Dutch were well aware of these activities on their soil and tried to profit from contacts with foreign agents in order to strengthen Dutch neutrality. This extensive counter espionage was successful in 1914–1918 but failed in 1939–1940. During the inter war years the Dutch service, modest in size, focused on curtailing ‘bolshevism’, a danger that came from abroad but formed an internal threat to state security.

The home front was the boundary where trenches were dug against disloyalty and sedition, against those within who challenged the mainstream culture. One aspect of this battle was the increased monitoring of groups and individuals. This saw the passing of new legislation to empower the often disparate military and intelligence organizations. In several places a sharp juxtapositioning of the dominant conservative culture against marginalized 'radical' cultures occurred. There were several challenges to the dominant culture; the story of the Russians in Brisbane being one amongst many based on political causes. The formation and growth of an official club, the Russian Workers Association, gave these alienated working migrants an association and a voice. With time, this voice began to represent a very specific identity for Russians in Brisbane, and indeed wider Australia. This paper looks at the characterization of the Association and its members in selected intelligence documents. Taking an historical approach, I argue that a clash between the 'language of bureaucracy' and the 'language of revolution' pervaded the official treatment of the Russian Workers Association. Conclusions drawn from these documents confirm that the conservative intelligence culture overestimated the 'threat' posed by the Russians.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BHC2S2EN,2006-02-24,Louise Curtis,,,2024-01-14T16:53:28Z,['BNPYHVD4']

Evidence indicates that the overall quality of intelligence was uneven, although reasonably accurate with regard to the Japanese navy.

The author has introduced into scholarly circulation a large set of unpublished documents stored in France’s National Archives and the Archive of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has come to the following conclusions. On the eve of and beginning of the War of 1812 the Russian Embassy in Paris, led by the ‘brilliant’ Prince A. B. Kurakin, played a very important role in the plan for Petersburg to obtain valuable information about the plans and operations of the adversary. Contrary to previous impressions, when the prince was depicted as a kind of ‘dummy’ or, in the best case, a ‘cover’ figure, convincing facts contained in French archive documents add a truly dramatic nuance to this historical personage. Possessing a political flair and extensive connections in Europe and the United States, Kurakin was able to quickly and precisely understand the true meaning of Napoleon’s actions and words and to inform Petersburg about this in a timely fashion. The Russian Embassy in Paris was the main center for the collection and analysis of varied information that attested to the French leadership’s sequential preparations for war against Russia. Despite the widespread opinion about the key role of Colonel A. I. Chernyshev in obtaining secret information about Napoleon’s war machine, the true ‘resident’ in Paris was, nevertheless, Kurakin. Moreover, Chernyshev’s ill-conceived and reckless actions threatened the embassy’s fulfillment of its intelligence functions. However, despite the emergence of serious problems associated with the disclosure of the ‘Chernyshev-Michel group’, Kurakin continued to actively collect intelligence about both Napoleon’s actions and plans and the domestic situation in France itself. Under conditions of the commencement of war between the two powers and his actually being a hostage, the prince did not cease his efforts to collect information and find methods for delivering it to the Russian leadership.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/DRCS9YQT,2018-01-02,Vladimir Zemtsov,,The Journal of Slavic Military Studies,2024-01-14T14:11:37Z,"['9DTPTK46', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

This thesis gauges the level of Russian democratic reform by analyzing the nature of its intelligence and security services. The autonomous and penetrative nature of the KGB clearly reflected the totalitarian nature of the Soviet Union. Now that Russia is a democracy, it follows that the current intelligence and security forces should be much less powerful than the KGB had been. Currently, the crises of regional militant nationalism, corruption, organized crime, and economic turmoil have allowed the services to retain a higher level of power than one would expect in a democratic state. Executive, legislative, and judicial oversight is dubious. Current laws allow the services to conduct penetrative investigations and surveillance. These same crises have created the conditions for a demoralized and underpaid security intelligence apparatus that is susceptible to corruption and freelancing. The conclusion of this thesis is that Russia's intelligence and security services are indeed less powerful than in the Soviet era, but they still are not appropriate for a liberal, democratic state. Russia still has not made the full transition to democracy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Q27QZLU2,1999-06-01,Thomas C. Muldoon,,,2024-01-14T12:54:12Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

The former were hidden, but knowable through the miracles of Ultra. The latter – Hitler's strategic intentions – were by contrast virtually impenetrable. Consequently, between 1940 and 1943 British intelligence used the talents of an astrologer, Louis de Wohl, who claimed – wrongly – that Hitler's strategic plans were astrologically inspired. However, as de Wohl's star began to wane he was talent-spotted by the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which employed him to disseminate black propaganda. He consequently travelled to the United States where, in tandem with British Security Co-ordination, he undermined American confidence in the invincibility of Hitler through astrological prognostications.

Much of the intelligence effort for East Asia also devolved upon the Americans. Yet, the British retained an intelligence interest there not least because of their extensive commercial assets in China and the region's proximity to Britain's imperial position in Southeast Asia.

Second, British strengths in the Far Eastern theaters were consistently limited by more pressing commitments arising from the war against Germany, thereby requiring Britain to cope with its Japanese adversary by employing its scarce resources in an economical manner.

Kino was an organisation first established in Britain in 1933 as the film section of the Workers’ Theatre Movement, and distributed films ranging from the works of major Soviet directors to a variety of propagandistic news films. In 1931 MI5 assumed the lead responsibility for monitoring domestic political subversion. With the increasing circulation of communist agitational material through Britain, cultural institutions overtly sympathetic to the Soviet Union or suspected of covert links to communist organisations were subjected to MI5 surveillance.

The conventional view is that Britain's MI6 waged a battle in the shadows consisting of espionage and covert action. However, a number of MI6 officers operated as observers, conducting what we might call ‘intelligence without espionage’. The dual identity of these officers raises important questions about how intelligence operated in the blurred space between traditional diplomacy and human espionage using agents. Using the case of MI6 officers in the British Consulate-General in Hanoi between 1965 and 1972, this article explores how a dual identity provided alternative means of acquiring intelligence within a highly secure state that exhibited remarkable paranoia about foreign spies. Furthermore, the United States lacked diplomatic representation in Hanoi and so the British Consulate provided a remarkable window for Western intelligence on the effect of ‘Operation Rolling Thunder’, Lyndon Johnson's escalating air campaign against North Vietnam. Both Johnson and Harold Wilson were avid readers of this material. Accordingly, in the context of the Cold War intelligence partnership between the UK and US, the consulate in Hanoi was an example of the ‘inverse’ special relationship, in which Britain enjoyed unique value.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/QW924HAU,2017-03-15,Nikita Wolf,,The International History Review,2024-01-13T19:00:21Z,['BHVIFBRH']

These archives reveal that de Gaulle failed to interest himself seriously in secret intelligence or subversion before the arrival of Jean Moulin in London in October 1941.

The British army's image of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) during the Pacific War (1941-45) was shaped by a logical analysis of the intelligence obtained through combat experience. Early in the war, the Japanese soldier's exceptional level of morale played a crucial role in enabling the IJA to oust the Allies from Southeast Asia. By late 1944, the British concluded that when the Japanese were being pushed back on all fronts their fighting spirit was prone to deteriorate when faced with setbacks and prolonged hardships on the battlefield, thus significantly damaging the IJA's capabilities.

Two main causes for this development can be identified. The first was conceptual, namely the increasing recognition that the study of international history was greatly impoverished by the reluctance of academic historians to address a subject which appeared capable of shedding considerable light upon the conduct of international affairs. Two leading historians underlined this during 1982 in a path-breaking collection of essays on the subject, suggesting that intelligence was the ‘missing dimension’ of most international history. The second development was a more practical one, the introduction of the Thirty Year Rule during the 1970s, bringing with it an avalanche of new documentation, which, within a few years, was recognized as containing a great deal of intelligence material. In the 1980s historians had begun to turn their attention in increasing numbers to the intelligence history of the mid-twentieth century.

In their breadth of coverage and information, their treatment of opinions and personalities, their abundance of detail and their fresh and unguarded prose, they are far more interesting, more accurate and more authoritative than either the various in-house MI5 section histories which have been opened to research in recent years, or the Hinsley Simkins volume of the official history of British intelligence.

These were not new problems – the UK intelligence community had been aware of the potential for cultural bias for decades but repeatedly failed to learn the appropriate lessons. In the case of Iraq these endemic problems led to failures at all four stages of the traditional intelligence cycle – requirement-setting, collection, assessment and dissemination. The overall result was a loss of public confidence in intelligence which may have lessened its overall influence in the wider strategic culture for many years. However, the main blame attaches to the politicians who misused and abused intelligence to justify their purely political decisions to undertake aggression against a sovereign state.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/H8PX483R,2011-08-01,John N.L.

It shows that Britain had access to human and signals intelligence on Indonesia, which influenced British policy and strategy in several ways. In particular, signals intelligence gave London the confidence to launch 'Claret' cross border raids against Indonesia from 1965. The study also reveals that Britain mounted an aggressive propaganda campaign against Indonesia during the Confrontation and especially after an abortive coup attempt in 1965.

They exposed and neutralised hundreds of Soviet agents who had penetrated government departments and democratic institutions. Stretching from Anatoli Granovsky in 1946 to Oleg Gordievsky in 1985, these Soviet defectors were highly prized for the intelligence they provided to security services. Ranked amongst the most valuable at the time was Vladimir Mikhailovich Petrov, who defected in Sydney in 1954. Yet he, almost alone, has overwhelmingly been cast by commentators and historians as lazy, inefficient, and incompetent. This article will offer an alternative interpretation of Petrov. My argument has three prongs. First, Petrov's contact with Russian individuals and pro-Soviet political organisations in Australia was far more extensive than generally assumed. Second, contrary to the historiographical consensus, he withheld intelligence about his contacts and informants from his security service debriefers. Third, rather than Petrov seeing espionage as too dangerous, as suggested, he was a committed and active Soviet intelligence cadre. By reappraising Petrov, the article seeks to provide a fresh understanding of this key episode, the Petrov Affair, in Australia's Cold War history.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/MZJYWBGY,2024-01-08,Phillip Deery,,Australian Journal of Politics & History,2024-01-13T13:49:35Z,['CZT6L9T7']

Yet despite Fleming’s grounding and experience in actual wartime intelligence operations and organisations, the origin of the Bond novels in real wartime intelligence has been neglected. Instead, the adventures of James Bond have more often been read as escapist fantasies concocted by Fleming for fame, profit, and imperial propaganda. This article will respond to this neglect of Fleming’s realism by tracing numerous parallels between wartime intelligence operations, agents, and institutions – such as Operation MINCEMEAT, Operation RUTHLESS, 30 Assault Unit, and Camp X – and the plots and personnel of Bond novels including Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker, From Russia, with Love, and On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. The article will further explore how Fleming artfully evaded the constraints of Official Secrecy by disguising classified intelligence material as ‘romanticized caricatures’ in his postwar spy fiction. The profound impact of Fleming’s personal wartime trauma on the Bond novels will also be examined to ground the stories more firmly in actual wartime experience and intelligence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/RTJIGFZA,2024-01-09,Oliver Buckton,,Intelligence and National Security,2024-01-13T13:43:50Z,['9YH9YSYQ']

Public discussion of prewar intelligence on Iraq has focused on the errors made in assessing Saddam Hussein's unconventional weapons programs. The intelligence community limits its judgments to what is happening or what might happen overseas, avoiding policy judgments about what the United States should do in response. The George H. W. Bush administration deviated from the professional standard not only in using policy to drive intelligence, but also in aggressively using intelligence to win public support for its decision to go to war.

It provides a sense of the many potential pitfalls in the conduct of intelligence that make some degree of failure inevitable. A useful analytic construct for understanding the hazards of intelligence is the so-called intelligence cycle, which traces how America's secret agencies gather, interpret, and disseminate information.

Decisionmakers might be better off if they understood the limitations of intelligence but this would place them under intolerable psychological and political pressures. One reason for the intelligence errors about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs is that the US believed that Iraq had an extensive denial and deception program. This explained why the US was seeing only scattered signs of the program. Designing policies that are likely to succeed if the intelligence is good but that will not fail disastrously if it is not is difficult.

The Iraqis took pains to carefully hide their WMD programs. The Iraqis had learned well about US intelligence during more than 10 years of confrontation and war. No single act of omission or commission accounts for the inconsistent analytic performance of the intelligence community with regard to Iraq.

A new approach to answering this question, the “selective attention thesis,” posits that individual perceptual biases and organizational interests and practices influence which types of indicators a state's political leaders and its intelligence community regard as credible signals of an adversary's intentions. Policymakers often base their interpretations on their own theories, expectations, and needs, sometimes ignoring costly signals and paying more attention to information that, though less costly, is more vivid (i.e., personalized and emotionally involving). In contrast, intelligence organizations typically prioritize the collection and analysis of data on the adversary's military inventory. Over time, these organizations develop substantial knowledge on these material indicators that they then use to make predictions about an adversary's intentions. An examination of three cases based on 30,000 archival documents and intelligence reports shows strong support for the selective attention thesis and mixed support for two other approaches in international relations theory aimed at understanding how observers are likely to infer adversaries' political intentions: the behavior thesis and the capabilities thesis. The three cases are assessments by President Jimmy Carter and officials in his administration of Soviet intentions during the collapse of détente; assessments by President Ronald Reagan and administration officials of Soviet intentions during the end of the Cold War; and British assessments of Nazi Germany before World War II.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/I9D8R5XN,2013-07-01,Keren Yarhi-Milo,,International Security,2024-01-13T13:23:14Z,"['B4CCZ7Y8', 'D67KFVND']"

Was this knowledge accurate - and just how did he know it? There have been several 'handbooks' of Second World War armies, but they never tell us exactly what the Allied soldier knew at the time, or how he was informed. This is of importance because it influenced both conduct on the battlefield, and the way in which the soldier thought about his enemy. The book explains the background history of the organisations involved, followed by short chapters based around a series of original documents. This puts the original into context and also discusses whether the document that follows was correct in the picture it painted, and what can be deduced about sources and the concerns of the intelligence officers who compiled the material. Most of the documents were produced at the time, by the British War Office or US War Department, and cover different aspects of the German Army, including tactics, weapons, and uniforms.

Subjects include: Allied intelligence on the German Army from 1930 onwards, British SIS / MI6 and US Military Intelligence. The organisations responsible, how they worked, and how they changed very rapidly with the coming of war.

S. intelligence during World War II, from Pearl Harbor through the plot against Hitler and the D-day invasion to the ""unconditional surrender"" of Japan, and reveals how better use of the intelligence available could have saved many lives and shortened the war. The following chapters dealing with the Cold War disclose what information and advice U. S. intelligence analysts passed on to policy makers, and also what sometimes bitter policy debates occurred within the Communist camp, concerning Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban missile crisis, the turmoil in Eastern Europe, the Six-Day and Yom Kippur wars in the Middle East, and the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. In many ways, this is a story of missed opportunities the U. S. government had to conduct a more responsible foreign policy that could have avoided large losses of life and massive expenditures on arms buildups.

Drawing on declassified archival documents and émigré sources, the article discusses how the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) used the NTS in covert operations to undermine Communism in Europe. Early operations to penetrate Soviet borders failed, as NTS members who were sent into the USSR were quickly rounded up amid suspicions of internal betrayal. Following Soviet attempts to kidnap and assassinate NTS leaders in Germany in 1954, the CIA adopted a new approach, using the émigré organization as a tool of political and psychological warfare. Borrowing political strategies used by the exiles themselves, the CIA promoted a false image of the NTS as a powerful underground organization in order to provoke the Soviet state into costly and destabilizing countermeasures against it. As a result, the NTS became a mythical organization, and the intelligence agencies of both superpowers sought to manipulate it to their advantage.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VBPWWP72,2016-01-01,Benjamin Tromly,,Journal of Cold War Studies,2024-01-13T13:10:43Z,['CZT6L9T7']
1295,"Sharing Secrets with Stalin: How the Allies Traded Intelligence, 1941-1945",Book,https://kansaspress.ku.edu/9780700608003,"Bestselling author Bradley Smith reveals the surprisingly rich exchange of wartime intelligence between the Anglo-American allies and the Soviet Union, as well as the procedures and politics that made such an exchange possible.

Between the late 1930s and 1945, allied intelligence organizations expanded at an enormous rate in order to acquire the secret information their governments needed to win the war. But, as Smith demonstrates, the demand for intelligence far outpaced the ability of any one ally to produce it. For that reason, Washington, London, and Moscow were compelled to share some of their most sensitive secrets.

Historians have long known about the close Anglo-American intelligence collaboration, but until now the Soviet connection has been largely unexplored. Smith contends that Cold War animosities helped keep this story from a public that might have found it hard to believe that such cooperation was ever possible. In fact, official denials—from such illustrious Cold Warriors as Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell and the CIA’s Sherman Kent—continued well into the late 1980s.

Smith argues that, contrary to the official story, Soviet-American intelligence exchanges were both extensive and successful. He shows that East and West were not as hostile to each other during the war or as determined to march right off into the Cold War as many have suggested. Among other things, he provides convincing evidence that the U.S. Army gave the Soviets its highest-grade ULTRA intelligence in August 1945 to speed up the Soviet advances in the Far East.

Based on interviews and enormous research in Anglo-American archives and despite limited access to tenaciously guarded Soviet documents, Smith’s book persuasively demonstrates how reluctant and suspicious allies, driven by the harsh realities of total war, finally set aside their ideological differences to work closely with people they neither trusted nor particularly liked.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/TJBM5C5Q,1996-10-04,Bradley F.

I classify current major challenges in intelligence into four groups. These are technological, financial, organizational, and political. Technological challenges are the most important ones because other challenges are either related to it or a result of it. These are the expansion of using meta-data, the expansion of social media, and cybersecurity. The second current challenge in intelligence is financial. It is mostly about the use of cryptocurrencies. The third challenge is organizational. These are the impact on information revolution on intelligence organizations and competition with non-intelligence organizations. The last current challenge in intelligence is political. Political challenges are populist nationalist movements, ISIS returnees, and expansion of hybrid warfare. Related to current challenges in intelligence and the global security environment, there are eight current trends in intelligence. Five of them are mostly related to technological challenges, while three of them are related to political challenges. The trends that are related to technological challenges in intelligence are the foundation of cyber intelligence divisions/agencies, the change in recruitment policies, the rising importance of the security of cyberinfrastructure, privatization of intelligence, and increasing role of open-source intelligence. The trends that are related to political challenges in intelligence are the increasing focus on right-wing groups, the elimination of ISIS returnees, and the increasing role of intelligence in hybrid warfare/covert operations.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/KACX8XBE,2020-05-12,Ahmet Ateş,,Güvenlik Bilimleri Dergisi,2024-01-13T13:03:02Z,['HCN8YFI8']

This survey article provides a broad overview of some of the new literature and documentation pertaining to Cold War era intelligence, as well as the key dimensions of the topic. Despite the continued obstacles posed by secrecy and the mixed reliability of sources, the publication of numerous memoirs and the release of a huge volume of fresh archival material in the post— Cold War era have opened new opportunities to study the role of intelligence in Cold War history. Scholars should explore not only the “micro level” of the problem (the impact of intelligence on specific events) but also the “macro level,” looking at the many ways that the Cold War as a whole (its origins, its course, and its outcome) was influenced, perhaps even shaped, by the intelligence agencies of the United States, the Soviet Union, and other key countries. It is also crucial to examine the unintended consequences of intelligence activities. Some interesting examples of “blowback” (effects that boomerang against the country that initiated them) have recently come to light from intelligence operations that the United States undertook against the Soviet Union.

But the overriding emphasis in these commissions' recommendations is on further vertically integrating intelligence collection, analysis, and operations. Such proposals to further centralize intelligence and unify command and control are not promising given recent transformations in Jihadist networks to a somewhat “leaderless resistance” in the wake of Al Qaeda's operational demise. To defeat terrorist networks requires grasping novel relations between an englobing messianic moral framework, the rootless intellectual and physical mobility of immigrant and diaspora communities, and the overarching conceptual, emotional, and logistical affordances of the Internet.

In the light of recent archival research, we now know this statement to be not entirely truthful. Using previously unpublished material from the Guy Liddell diaries, the memoirs of the late Hugh Trevor-Roper, and a selection of Foreign Office (FO) minutes and wartime interrogation reports, this article will aim to overturn the prevailing view that the July bomb plot and its antecedents represented a British ‘intelligence failure’ as opposed to a failure of political judgement and imagination on the part of Churchill, Eden, and the FO. It will be asserted that, because of a mixture of political indifference and ‘group think’, crucial intelligence concerning the existence of a determined anti-Hitler resistance was ignored. Documentary evidence confirms that when von Stauffenberg’s bomb exploded the officially held view that no such element existed in Germany, senior figures in Whitehall were ‘naked’ in the face of events. These officials were victims not only of their own political misjudgement, but ultimately of the Churchillian policy of ‘absolute silence’ which ensured that the intelligence cupboard was bare at the very moment they, as ‘consumers’ of intelligence, were most hungry for information.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZXWDGDVG,2006-11-01,P.

It was a direct action raid, which involved an airborne (parachute and glider) assault by 500 SS Fallschirmjäger (Parachute) Battalion on the suspected site of Tito's Headquarters and a subsequent linkup with the German XV Mountain Corps converging from all directions. Operation RÖSSELSPRUNG failed due to mediocre intelligence support and inadequate tactical level planning. Intelligence shortfalls were rooted primarily in poor German inter-organization relations and cooperation, including the sharing of intelligence, which resulted in missed opportunities and a failure to pinpoint Tito's location with sufficient precision. Given the quality of intelligence provided, the plan for the airborne assault did not include sufficient flexibility for the execution of contingencies. There are three major conclusions from the failure of this operation that can be applied to contemporary operations of a similar nature. First, the degree of intelligence certainty is critical in determining both the size of the force and the extent of the objective area in a direct action raid. Second is the requirement for contingency planning, which provides commanders with flexibility once an operation has commenced to deal with the unexpected, and is especially vital in the face of uncertain intelligence. Finally, and probably most critical, is the importance of interagency intelligence cooperation. It is vital that different intelligence organizations that are pursuing a similar goal, especially in the same theater of operations, cooperate to the greatest extent possible.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XN9YD73Y,2006-07-01,Lieutenant-Colonel Wayne D.

Unlike SOE's broad mandate to sow dissent and disarray in occupied countries, in Spain agents were forbidden from any involvement in direct action and sabotage. Diplomatic concerns, namely the maintenance of Spanish neutrality in the war, overrode all other strategic issues in Iberia. SOE agents and leaders in Madrid, therefore, attempted to create a different role for themselves. Drawing on files released in the Public Record Office in 1998, the article highlights SOE's limited success in the effort to establish for itself a part in the Allied strategic and diplomatic campaign against German wolfram smuggling. Success proved fleeting, however, and SOE's ultimate failure, in the face of hostility from the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), to prove its usefulness beyond the wolfram campaign, would lead to its withdrawal from Spain. The story of the SOE in Spain represents, on a small scale, the failure of the organization to find a niche in the British intelligence community after the Second World War.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/4UEKN9R2,2000-09-01,David A.

Since the end of the 1980s, the world economy has evolved, and there has been a rapid movement towards globalization. The end of the Cold War coincided with the end of “traditional” conflicts and a new dominant paradigm appeared. The terms of economic war and international competitiveness became inescapable issues dealt at the same moment by economists and the whole politico-administrative sphere. However, as Krugman (1996) noted this vision can turn out dangerous if it leans on erroneous diagnoses. Economic intelligence appears in this particular context. From a theoretical point of view, economic intelligence is presented in Michael Porter's works, for example in his article with V. E. Millar, “How information gives you competitive advantage”. Empirically, economic intelligence is not a new phenomenon.

This gap can be filled by drawing on private papers and documents in the National Archives from MI5, Bletchley Park, the War Office and the Admiralty. The official historians F.H. Hinsley and C.A.G. Simkins praised RSS efficiency, but MI5 records suggest that while RSS voluntary interceptors were competent, the same was not always true of some other operatives.The most intellectually outstanding part of the Radio Security Service was its Analysis Bureau, which became part of Section V of the Secret Intelligence Service [SIS] as Vw when most of RSS was taken over by Section VIII of SIS in 1941. Under Hugh Trevor-Roper's leadership Vw produced analytical reports on Axis Intelligence activities, but Felix Cowgill, the head of Section V, sought to restrict the circulation of these reports and the decrypts of enemy secret service messages which they analysed. The diaries of MI5's Guy Liddell suggest that Cowgill's behaviour was a catalyst for the unsuccessful attempt by MI5 to take over Section V of SIS during 1942.By 1943 Stewart Menzies, the Chief of SIS, was so impressed by Vw that he made it independent of Cowgill as the Radio Intelligence Service.

These gave airmen insights on the effectiveness of bombing. Air intelligence emerged as a new specialty during the Great War. By 1918, an intellectual infrastructure with organizational and technological components had developed in the British and American air arms. The organizational elements included air staffs with intelligence specialists who provided BDA reports to senior airmen, and unit-level intelligence sections to assess the effects of individual bombing raids. The technologies included reconnaissance aircraft and cameras to collect photographs on the effects of bombing. Although bombing and BDA remained rudimentary in 1918, they set a precedent for World War II. During the interwar period, despite organizational retrenchment, technology, especially cameras, made rapid advances. In addition, the emergence of a strategic bombing doctrine and a heavy bomber, the B-17, in the U.S., heralded the arrival of a mature bombing capability. In Great Britain, the threat of war prompted leaders to begin rebuilding their BDA intellectual infrastructure. Although early British bombing was ineffective, it allowed BDA experts to learn their trade. The combination of new BDA organizations and advanced technologies resulted in superb BDA. Once American air intelligence personnel began arriving in 1942, an Anglo-American intellectual infrastructure emerged. After the Allies gained air supremacy, bombers engaged in three campaigns of decisive importance for Allied victory, first against French and Belgian railroads to isolate Normandy from German reinforcements and re-supply, then against Germany’s oil industry, and finally against Germany’s transportation networks. BDA experts gave airmen accurate insights on the effectiveness of these campaigns. The first campaign played a vital role in the collapse of German resistance in Normandy. The second had disastrous effects on fuel production and thus on the Wehrmacht’s combat power. The third undermined Germany’s war economy. In each campaign, BDA experts gave targeting committees the insights required to recommend the most lucrative targets. The results were cataclysmic for Germany’s war effort. By approaching these campaigns from an air intelligence perspective, these facts become clear.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Q66NQJ7T,2005,Robert S.

During the Cold War, only the alliances clustered around the two superpowers maintained viable intelligence endeavors, whereas a century ago, many states could aspire to be competitive at these dark arts. Today, larger states have lost their monopoly on intelligence skills and capabilities as technological and sociopolitical changes have made it possible for private organizations and even individuals to unearth secrets and influence global events.

Historian Michael Warner addresses the birth of professional intelligence in Europe at the beginning of the twentieth century and the subsequent rise of US intelligence during the Cold War. He brings this history up to the present day as intelligence agencies used the struggle against terrorism and the digital revolution to improve capabilities in the 2000s. Throughout, the book examines how states and other entities use intelligence to create, exploit, and protect secret advantages against others, and emphasizes how technological advancement and ideological competition drive intelligence, improving its techniques and creating a need for intelligence and counterintelligence activities to serve and protect policymakers and commanders.

The world changes intelligence and intelligence changes the world.

These intelligence pioneers invented techniques, procedures, and equipment from scratch, not only allowing the United States to hold its own in the Pacific despite the loss of most of its Fleet at Pearl Harbor, but also laying the foundation of today’s intelligence methods and agencies.

One-hundred years ago, in what was clearly an unsophisticated pre-information era, naval intelligence (and foreign intelligence in general) existed in rudimentary forms almost incomprehensible to us today. Founded in 1882, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI)—the modern world’s “oldest continuously operating intelligence agency”—functioned for at least its first forty years with low manning, small budgets, low priority, and no prestige. The navy’s early steps into communications intelligence (COMINT), which included activities such as radio interception, radio traffic analysis, and cryptology, came with the 1916 establishment of the Code and Signals Section within the navy’s Division of Communications and with the 1924 creation of the “Research Desk” as part of the Section. Like ONI, this COMINT organization suffered from low budgets, manning, priority, and prestige.

The dictionary focuses on these pioneers, many of whom went on, even after World War II, to important positions in the Navy, the State Department, the Armed Forces Security Agency, the National Security Agency, and the Central Intelligence Agency.

Yevgeni Brik was a KGB deep cover illegal who had been dispatched to Canada in 1951. He settled in Verdun, Quebec. He eventually became the KGB Illegal Resident where he had responsibility for running a number of agents, one of whom was working on the CF-105, Avro Arrow. In 1953, he fell in love with a married Canadian woman to whom he revealed his true identity. She persuaded him to turn himself in, which resulted in his becoming a double agent, working for Canada. He was later betrayed by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police Officer, James Morrison, who sought money from the KGB to pay his debts. Brik was consequently lured back to Moscow in 1955, where he was arrested, and interrogated. Convicted of treason, a traitor’s fate awaited him, predictable, grim and final. Incredibly, he reappeared at a British Embassy as an old man in 1992, seeking Canada’s help. He was exfiltrated by a joint Canadian / British intelligence team which was headed by Donald Mahar.

Using the UK as a case study, this book addresses this question by providing the first systematic exploration of how accountability is understood inside the secret world. It is based on new interviews with current and former UK intelligence practitioners, as well as extensive research into the performance and scrutiny of the UK intelligence machinery. The result is the first detailed analysis of how intelligence professionals view their role, what they feel keeps them honest, and how far external overseers impact on their work

Moving beyond the conventional focus on oversight, the book examines how accountability works in the day to day lives of these organizations, and considers the impact of technological and social changes, such as artificial intelligence and social media.

The UK is a useful case study as it is an important actor in global intelligence, gathering material that helps inform global decisions on such issues as nuclear proliferation, terrorism, transnational crime, and breaches of international humanitarian law. On the flip side, the UK was a major contributor to the intelligence failures leading to the Iraq war in 2003, and its agencies were complicit in the widely discredited U.S. practices of torture and “rendition” of terrorism suspects. UK agencies have come under greater scrutiny since those actions, but it is clear that problems remain.

It is the hidden piece of the jigsaw puzzle of global relations that cements relationships, undermines alliances and topples tyrants, and after many decades of being deliberately overlooked or avoided, it is now regarded as a subject of legitimate study by academics and historians.

This second edition of Historical Dictionary of International Intelligence covers its history through a chronology, an introductory essay, and an extensive bibliography. The dictionary section has over 500 cross-referenced entries on espionage techniques, categories of agents, crucial operations spies, defectors, moles, double and triple agents, and the tradecraft they apply.

Many instructors look for interactive learning tools because they add immeasurable value to the student’s understanding of the intelligence enterprise. Such tools, however, take time and effort to develop and are not circulated among faculty.

This is the first textbook to offer in one volume original simulations, exercises, and games designed by academics and intelligence professionals from several countries. These innovative methods are meant to enhance the learning experience and provide an international perspective to the topics and approaches discussed in class.

Intelligence simulations and games are presented in ready-to run formats, from easy instructions to result recordings matrices, to minimize preparation time for both instructors and students. Exercises, such as cyber attack simulation, information sharing, ethical scenarios and more, expose the student to the many subtle aspects of the intelligence enterprise through active role-playing in simulations and game exercises.

The first book was an abridged version of Grabo’s 1972 manuscript, of which only 200 pages were allowed to be published by the government. The second book was published after it was agreed that the last 10 chapters would remain classified. These final 10 chapters have recently been released by the government and complete the manuscript as it was originally intended to be published by the author in 1972.

The Handbook of Warning Intelligence was written during the cold war and was classified for 40 years. Originally written as a manual for training intelligence analysts, it explains the fundamentals of intelligence analysis and forecasting, discusses military analysis, as well as the difficulties in understanding political, civil, and economic analysis and assessing what it means for analysts to have ""warning judgment.""

Much of what Grabo wrote in her book seems to appear in many of the numerous commission reports that emerged after the 9/11 attacks. However, her book was written in response to the ""surprise attack"" of the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. According to the author, that event was no surprise. And while analysts have to take some of the blame for their failure to strenuously present their case that the threat was real and imminent, what occurred was a failure by policymakers to listen to the warning intelligence reports that were written at the time.

In these last chapters, Grabo discusses scenarios where the United States will need to take action, especially describing Soviet indicators of such action. She also talks on how to influence policymakers to take, or not take, action based on intelligence. After the Soviet Union fell, the government was hesitant to release this information—especially considering what's going on with Putin today.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/X7EMJE25,2015-09-01,Cynthia Grabo,Rowman & Littlefield,,2024-01-12T20:04:30Z,['9YPHGMBS']

After beginning with an examination of how people’s attention spans, working memories, and capacity for deep thought and reading are being imperiled by their addictive use of smart phones and PCs, the discussion continues with how this may be occurring at a deep level at which the brain creates short and long-term memories, pays attention, and thinks creatively.


The book then explores how these negative effects may impede the search to explore the limits of one’s thinking mind and memories in pursuit of a larger intelligence. People may have fewer opportunities to be successful in this pursuit simply because they will have lost access to important personal dynamics due to the effects of the digital world on their minds, brains, and inner lives.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/LMMQVL7Y,2019-11-01,Lyn Lesch,Rowman & Littlefield,,2024-01-12T20:01:33Z,['HCN8YFI8']

Wolf was undoubtedly the greatest spymaster of our century. A shadowy Cold War legend who kept his own past locked up as tightly as the state secrets with which he was entrusted, Wolf finally broke his silence in 1997. Man Without a Face is the result. It details all of Wolf’s major successes and failures and illuminates the reality of espionage operations as few nonfiction works before it. Wolf tells the real story of Gunter Guillaume, the East German spy who brought down Willy Brandt. He reveals the truth behind East Germany’s involvment with terrorism. He takes us inside the bowels of the Stasi headquarters and inside the minds of Eastern Bloc leaders.

In addition, he was to gain wider notoriety in the early 1980s as the man who helped authenticate the forged Hitler Diaries. Nevertheless, his wartime embodiment as a British intelligence officer is one facet of his personal history that has never before been addressed by scholars in any great depth. Using previously unpublished material from Trevor-Roper's memoirs and personal papers, as well as excerpts from the Guy Liddell Diaries, this article aims to highlight the fact that, contrary to the impression engendered by F.H. Hinsley's dry and depersonalized multi-volume official history, British Intelligence in the Second World War, Major H.R. Trevor-Roper, and many other intelligence officers like him, not only had a ‘good war’, but a rich and colourful one. If historians are to escape the late Sir Maurice Oldfield's indictment of that official history, namely, that it was written ‘by a committee, about committees, for a committee’, they might do worse than begin to reappraise the role of the individual in the context of Britain's intelligence effort during 1939–45.

It was not ignorance of the geography which plagued the Romans; they knew exactly where they were going. The Roman commander Varus left his summer camp on the Weser and returned to his winter camp, taking with him the XVIIth, XVIIIth and the XIXth Legions, their equipment and all the other inhabitants of the camp. They never arrived. They were guided by a German chieftain whose intent was to lead an insurgency against Rome.

Yet for militants who do not seek ethnic separation as a political goal, indiscriminate attacks are detrimental to their cause. Under what circumstances are such combatants more or less likely to commit ethnic violence?Nils Hägerdal examines the Lebanese civil war to offer a new theory that highlights the interplay of ethnicity and intelligence gathering. He shows that when militias can obtain reliable intelligence—particularly in demographically intermixed areas where information can cross ethnic boundaries—they are likely to refrain from indiscriminate tactics. Access to local intelligence helps armed groups distinguish between neutral and hostile non-coethnics to target individual opponents while leaving civilians in peace. Conversely, when militias struggle to access local information, they often fall back on ethnicity as a proxy for political allegiance, with bloody consequences. As intelligence capabilities shape the course of sectarian strife, the role of ethnicity can vary even within a particular conflict.Hägerdal conducted sixteen months of fieldwork in Lebanon, interviewing former militia fighters and commanders and collecting novel statistical evidence. He combines documentation by government agencies, NGOs, local news media, and the United Nations with firsthand narratives by participants to provide an unparalleled account of the processes that generate violence or coexistence when a diverse society descends into armed conflict. Theoretically innovative and descriptively rich, Friend or Foe sheds new light on the logic and dynamics of ethnic violence in civil wars.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PTIVRQLB,2021-07-01,Nils Hägerdal,Columbia University Press,,2023-03-28T09:14:15Z,"['CZT6L9T7', 'TLFN4NAL']"

Some of the countries examined are former Communist countries and several in Latin America are former military regimes. Others have been democratic for a long time but still experience widespread political violence. Through a mix of single-country and comparative studies, major aspects of intelligence are considered, including the legacy of, and transition from, authoritarianism; the difficulties of achieving genuine reform; and the apparent inevitability of periodic scandals. Authors consider a range of methodological approaches to the study of intelligence and the challenges of analysing the secret world. Finally, consideration is given to the success – or otherwise – of intelligence reform, and the effectiveness of democratic institutions of control and oversight.

There, it is more challenging to bring intelligence services under democratic control without sacrificing their efficiency in exchange for oversight. This research note analyses these challenges in the Brazilian case, contributing to the scholarship on intelligence in Latin America. The case study demonstrates that the restructuring of intelligence in Brazil resulted in a spread-out intelligence system with many agencies, aimed at avoiding monopolisation and politicisation with formal oversight mechanisms put in place. Nonetheless, Brazilian society and politicians still do not trust intelligence, and lack a clear understanding of its functions for a democratic state. While intelligence reform in Brazil still has a long way to go regarding intelligence effectiveness and efficiency, it indicates how intelligence reform is a central part of a successful democratic transition.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XRM73QAP,2020-06-29,Clara Ribeiro Assumpção,,Politikon: The IAPSS Journal of Political Science,2024-01-12T15:01:01Z,"['DVEM4H4W', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Punctuated Equilibrium theory is reviewed and employed to explain one institutional crisis in each of Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, and India. In Brazil, the case study is the fall of the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN) director in 2008, following the Satiagraha operation conducted by the Federal Police Department (DPF). In Colombia, the 2009 wiretapping scandal known as chuzadas is examined. In South Africa, the investigation in Project Avani (2006–8) is reviewed. Finally, in India the case study is the intelligence crisis following the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008. We found that institutional crises are inevitable because there are tensions between security and democracy, both being co-evolutionary dimensions of successful contemporary state building. However, the impacts of such crises vary across the four cases pending on three variables: (1) degree of functional specialization inside the national intelligence system; (2) degree of external public control over the national intelligence system; (3) whether effectiveness, legitimacy or both were the main drivers of the crisis. Our analysis of the four case studies suggests that the amount of positive institutional change in the aftermath of an intelligence crisis is greater in countries with more functional specialization and stronger external control mechanisms.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/56EH2X2A,2014-07-04,"Marco Cepik, Christiano Ambros",,Intelligence and National Security,2024-01-12T14:55:47Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

Regarding organizational configuration, similarities were found between India and Russia, as well as between China and South Africa. Brazil differs from the four countries. As for the power distribution, in Russia, Brazil, and India intelligence is subordinated to the government, and shows more centrality in the cases of China and South Africa. Finally, Russia runs the highest risk of having an intelligence system less able to adapt to strategic circumstances, at the same time being the most resilient among the five countries.

1393,Organizational Intelligence: Knowledge and Policy in Government and Industry,Book,,"The prize-winning book Organizational Intelligence focuses on the structural and ideological roots of intelligence (informational and analytical) failures in government, industry, and other institutions. It provides groundbreaking theory and structure to the analysis of decision-making processes and their breakdowns, as well as the interactions among experts and the organizations they inform. In this book, both &quot;organization&quot; and &quot;intelligence&quot; are taken to their larger meanings, not just focused on the military meaning of intelligence or on one set of institutions in society. Astute illustrations of intelligence failures abound from real-world cases, such as foreign policy (the Bay of Pigs, Soviet predictions in the Cuban missile crisis), military (civilian bombing of Germany, Pearl Harbor), financial (AmEx&#39;s investment in a vegetable oil guru), economics (the Council of Economic Advisers) and industrial production (Ford&#39;s Edsel), as well as many other telling arenas and disciplines. Economic, cultural, legal, and political contexts are considered, as well as the more known institutions of government and commerce. The new Classics of the Social Sciences edition from Quid Pro Books features a 2015 Foreword from Neil J. Smelser, University Professor Emeritus at Berkeley and former chair of its sociology department. He writes that the book remains &quot;one of the classics in organizational studies, and—in ways I will indicate—it is still directly relevant to current and future problems of organizational life. ... What makes this book a classic? It is a disciplined, intelligent, and elegant model of applied social science. ... The text itself, richly documented empirically, yields an informed and balanced account of the decision-making process as this is shaped by the quality of information available (and unavailable) to and used (and not used) by organizational leaders.&quot; Reviews of the book at the time it was written similarly attest to the originality and breadth of its interdisciplinary analysis. Amitai Etzioni wrote in the American Sociological Review: &quot;This book opens a whole new field — the macrosociology of knowledge. It is as different from the traditional sociology of knowledge as the study of interaction is from that of the structure of total societies.&quot; He adds, &quot;The power of Wilensky&#39;s contribution is further magnified by his historical perspective. He studies structures and processes, but not in a vacuum.&quot; Gordon Craig wrote in The Reporter that the book&#39;s examples from organizations &quot;show a similar tendency to believe what they want to believe, to become the victims of their own slogans and propaganda, and to resist or to silence warning voices that challenge their assumptions.... In his fascinating analysis of intelligence failures and their causes ... in the public and private sectors, Wilensky finds that the most disastrous miscalculations are those which have occurred in the field of governmental operations, especially foreign policy and national security.&quot; The book explains how such highly institutionalized actors are vulnerable to informational pathologies.The new digital edition features active Contents, a fully linked Index, linked notes, and proper ebook formatting.

What are the secret services–the CIA, the KGB, MI5, Mossad, Boss, Savak, Dina–doing these days? Global Intelligence explains how the war on terrorism has altered the context for the murky world of secret services and intelligence agencies. The CIA and other U.S. agencies, the FSB (successor to the KGB) in Russia, Western Europe’s secret services, Mossad in Israel, and the diverse security services in developing countries continue to operate, albeit with changing priorities and working methods. These shifting means of working, coupled with ultra-modern technologies, allow for more invasive spying in a global and domestic context.This up-to-date account raises important issues, including the new roles the secret services have found for themselves as they target “rogue states,”the war on drugs,” and “terrorists.” Most important of all, its authors explore the unsolved contradiction between the world of these secretive and unaccountable agencies operating on the fringes of the law, and the requirements of a free and democratic society.

The elimination of Palestinian leaders and militants has not decreased the incidence of Palestinian terrorism, for example. In fact, these incidents have become more lethal than ever, and ample evidence suggests that the actions of Israeli intelligence have fueled terrorist activities across the globe.An expert on terror and political extremism, Ami Pedahzur argues that Israel's strict reliance on the elite units of the intelligence community is fundamentally flawed. A unique synthesis of memoir, academic research, and information gathered from print and online sources, Pedahzur's complex study explores this issue through Israel's past encounters with terrorists, specifically hostage rescue missions, the first and second wars in Lebanon, the challenges of the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian terrorist groups, and Hezbollah. He brings a rare transparency to Israel's counterterrorist activities, highlighting their successes and failures and the factors that have contributed to these results. From the foundations of this analysis, Pedahzur ultimately builds a strategy for future confrontation that will be relevant not only to Israel but also to other countries that have adopted Israel's intelligence-based model.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5CR6QIXY,2009-02-01,Ami Pedahzur,Columbia University Press,,2024-01-12T13:39:33Z,"['CK5MNYPQ', 'TLFN4NAL', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"
1399,The Shadow War Against Hitler: The Covert Operations of America's Wartime Secret Intelligence Service,Book,,"Surveying the expanding conflict in Europe during one of his famous fireside chats in 1940, President Franklin Roosevelt ominously warned that ""we know of other methods, new methods of attack. The Trojan horse. The fifth column that betrays a nation unprepared for treachery. Spies, saboteurs, and traitors are the actors in this new strategy."" Having identified a new type of war—a shadow war—being perpetrated by Hitler's Germany, FDR decided to fight fire with fire, authorizing the formation of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) to organize and oversee covert operations. Based on an extensive analysis of OSS records, including the vast trove of records released by the CIA in the 1980s and '90s, as well as a new set of interviews with OSS veterans conducted by the author and a team of American scholars from 1995 to 1997, The Shadow War Against Hitler is the full story of America's far-flung secret intelligence apparatus during World War II. In addition to its responsibilities generating, processing, and interpreting intelligence information, the OSS orchestrated all manner of dark operations, including extending feelers to anti-Hitler elements, infiltrating spies and sabotage agents behind enemy lines, and implementing propaganda programs. Planned and directed from Washington, the anti-Hitler campaign was largely conducted in Europe, especially through the OSS's foreign outposts in Bern and London. A fascinating cast of characters made the OSS run: William J. Donovan, one of the most decorated individuals in the American military who became the driving force behind the OSS's genesis; Allen Dulles, the future CIA chief who ran the Bern office, which he called ""the big window onto the fascist world""; a veritable pantheon of Ivy League academics who were recruited to work for the intelligence services; and, not least, Roosevelt himself. A major contribution of the book is the story of how FDR employed Hitler's former propaganda chief, Ernst ""Putzi"" Hanfstengl, as a private spy.More than a record of dramatic incidents and daring personalities, this book adds significantly to our understanding of how the United States fought World War II. It demonstrates that the extent, and limitations, of secret intelligence information shaped not only the conduct of the war but also the face of the world that emerged from the shadows.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/J9FNPRCX,2003-04-01,Christof Mauch,Columbia University Press,,2024-01-12T13:41:25Z,['SCCGXHMZ']
1400,Enemies of Intelligence Knowledge and Power in American National Security,Book,http://kcl.eblib.com/patron/FullRecord.aspx?p=908240,"The tragic events of September 11, 2001, and the false assessment of Saddam Hussein's weapons arsenal were terrible reminders that good information is essential to national security. These failures convinced the American public that their intelligence system was broken and prompted a radical reorganization of agencies and personnel, but as Richard K. Betts argues in this book, critics and politicians have severely underestimated the obstacles to true reform.

One of the nation's foremost political scientists, Betts draws on three decades of work within the U.S. intelligence community to illuminate the paradoxes and problems that frustrate the intelligence process. Unlike America's efforts to improve its defenses against natural disasters, strengthening its strategic assessment capabilities means outwitting crafty enemies who operate beyond U.S. borders. It also requires looking within to the organizational and political dynamics of collecting information and determining its implications for policy.

Combining academic research with personal experience, Betts outlines strategies for better intelligence gathering and assessment. He describes how fixing one malfunction can create another; in what ways expertise can be both a vital tool and a source of error and misjudgment; the pitfalls of always striving for accuracy in intelligence, which in some cases can render it worthless; the danger, though unavoidable, of ""politicizing"" intelligence; and the issue of secrecywhen it is excessive, when it is insufficient, and how limiting privacy can in fact protect civil liberties.

Betts argues that when it comes to intelligence, citizens and politicians should focus less on consistent solutions and more on achieving a delicate balance between conflicting requirements. He also emphasizes the substantial success of the intelligence community, despite its well-publicized blunders, and highlights elements of the intelligence process that need preservation and protection. Many reformers are quick to respond to scandals and failures without detailed, historical knowledge of how the system works. Grounding his arguments in extensive theory and policy analysis, Betts takes a comprehensive and realistic look at how knowledge and power can work together to face the intelligence challenges of the twenty-first century.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/TU6HRPQB,2007,Richard K.

1401,Targeting the Third Reich: Air Intelligence and the Allied Bombing Campaigns,Book,https://kansaspress.ku.edu/9780700621446,"When large formations of Allied four-engine bombers finally flew over Europe, it marked the beginning of the end for the Third Reich. Their relentless hammering of Germany—totaling more than 1.4 million missions—took out oil refineries, industries, and transportation infrastructures vital to the Reich’s war effort. While other accounts have focused on operational details, this is the first book to reveal the crucial role of air intelligence in these dramatic campaigns.

Robert Ehlers reexamines these bombings through the lens of both air intelligence and operations, a dual approach that shows how the former was so vital to the latter’s success. Air intelligence was essential to both targeting and damage assessment, and by demonstrating its contributions to the Combined Bomber Offensive of 1943-1945, Ehlers provides a wealth of new insight into the war.

Ehlers describes the close ties that developed between the Royal Air Force’s “precision intelligence” arm and the U.S. Army Air Force’s “precision bombardment” forces, telling how the RAF’s photographic reconnaissance and signals intelligence steered both British and American bombers to the right targets at the right intervals with the right munitions. He shows that the greatest strength of this partnership was its ability to orchestrate all aspects of damage assessment within an effective organizational structure, so that by 1944 senior air commanders—like the RAF’s Arthur “Bomber” Harris and the AAF’s Carl “Tooey” Spaatz—could gauge the accuracy of bombing with a high degree of precision, analyze its effects on the German war effort, and determine its effectiveness in helping the Allies achieve strategic objectives.

Ehlers focuses on three key offensives in 1944—against French and Belgian rail supply lines delivering German troops and supplies to Normandy, against German oil refineries, and against railroads and waterways inside the Reich—that had a disastrous effect on the Nazi war effort. In the process, he underscores the degree to which bombers constituted part of a highly effective combined-arms force, giving Allied armies crucial advantages on the battlefield. Drawing on a huge collection of bomb-damage assessment photographs and a wealth of other archival sources, he shows that the success of these and other efforts can be traced directly to the success of air intelligence.

Providing a deeper and more accurate understanding of the bomber campaigns’ role in the Allied victory, Ehlers’s study testifies to the strategic importance of these efforts in that war and provides a tool for understanding the importance of intelligence operations in future conflicts.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/T42RD3CF,2009-11-01,Robert S.

1404,The International Politics of Intelligence Sharing,Book,https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-international-politics-of-intelligence-sharing/9780231154109,"The cross-border sharing of intelligence is fundamental to the establishment and preservation of security and stability. The American invasion of Iraq in 2003 was based in part on flawed intelligence, and current efforts to defeat al Qaeda would not be possible without an exchange of information among Britain, Pakistan, Indonesia, and the United States. While critical to national security and political campaigns, intelligence sharing can also be a minefield of manipulation and maneuvering, especially when secrecy makes independent verification of sources impossible. In The International Politics of Intelligence Sharing, James Igoe Walsh advances novel strategies for securing more reliable intelligence. His approach puts states that seek information in control of other states' intelligence efforts. According to this hierarchical framework, states regularly draw agreements in which one power directly monitors and acts on another power's information-gathering activities-a more streamlined approach that prevents the dissemination of false ""secrets."" In developing this strategy, Walsh draws on recent theories of international cooperation and evaluates both historical and contemporary case studies of intelligence sharing.

Focusing especially on the officers serving with the Psychological Warfare Division (PWD), I will demonstrate that field intelligence officers’ stance towards German civilians was fluid and often ambiguous, with the encounter causing considerable distress to some of them. Their reports and correspondence further suggest that in this period, Germans readily professed knowledge of atrocities. But contrary to intelligence officers’ expectations, they failed to accept any guilt or responsibility. Finally, I will argue that the very foundations and techniques of Western Allied psychological warfare may have reinforced and legitimised justification strategies that separated between “real” Nazis and everyone else. This was at odds with one of the central aims of Military Government, i.e. to inculcate a sense of culpability in Germans., Dieser Beitrag untersucht die Begegnungen mit deutschen Zivilist*innen und deren Befragungen durch alliierte Offiziere ab Herbst 1944 sowie auf Zivilist*innen abzielende Aktivitäten psychologischer Kriegsführung und deren Auswirkungen.

Ihre Berichte und Korrespondenz legen außerdem nahe, dass Deutsche während dieser Zeit bereitwillig Kenntnis von Gräueltaten eingestanden. Konträr zu den Erwartungen der befragenden Offiziere zeigten sie jedoch keine Schuldgefühle und übernahmen keine Verantwortung.

I argue that the end of the Cold War, the 1991 August Coup particularly, dramatically affected Soviet/Russian intelligence organizations. I also argue that the transformation of the Russian intelligence community took place in three domains: change in the philosophy of Russian intelligence, change in Russian intelligence tradecraft and organizational change within the Russian intelligence community. First, Russian policymakers realized that KGB not only involved the August Coup that accelerated the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics but also failed to predict the end of the Cold war and it operated as an ideological guardian of the Soviet regime instead of an intelligence organization.

1412,"Origins and Impact of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Provisions That Expired on March 15, 2020",Report,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40138,"Congress enacted two amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in 2001
as part of the USA PATRIOT Act. Section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act amended FISA to 
permit multipoint, or “roving,” wiretaps by adding flexibility to the degree of specificity with 
which the location or facility subject to electronic surveillance under FISA must be identified. Section 215 enlarged the scope 
of materials that could be sought under FISA to include “any tangible thing.” It also lowered the standard required for a court 
to compel their production.
Congress enacted a third FISA amendment in 2004, as part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act 
(IRTPA). Section 6001(a) of the IRTPA changed the rules regarding the types of individuals who may be targets of FISA authorized searches. Also known as the “lone wolf” provision, it permits surveillance of non-U.S. persons engaged in 
international terrorism without requiring evidence linking those people to an identifiable foreign power or terrorist 
organization.
In summer 2013, media began reporting on several foreign intelligence activities conducted by the National Security Agency 
(NSA), including the bulk collection of telephone metadata under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. After a one-day 
lapse in the expiring authorities, Congress enacted the USA FREEDOM Act, which placed new limitations on the scope of 
the government’s foreign intelligence activities, while simultaneously extending the expired provisions through March 15, 
2020.

1413,Surveillance of Foreigners Outside the United States Under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA,Report,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44457,"After the attacks of September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush authorized the National 
Security Agency to conduct a Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) to “intercept international 
communications into and out of the United States” by “persons linked to al Qaeda or related 
terrorist organizations.” After the TSP activities were concluded in 2007, Congress enacted the 
Protect America Act (PAA, P.L. 110-55), which established a mechanism for the acquisition, via a 
joint certification by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the Attorney General (AG), 
but without an individualized court order, of foreign intelligence information concerning a person 
reasonably believed to be outside the United States. This temporary authority ultimately expired 
after approximately six months, on February 16, 2008. Several months later, Congress enacted the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendments Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-261), which 
created separate procedures for targeting non-U.S. persons and U.S. persons reasonably believed 
to be outside the United States under a new Title VII of FISA. Title VII of FISA was reauthorized 
in late 2012 (P.L. 112-238); this authority now sunsets on December 31, 2017.
Significant details about the use and implementation of Section 702 of Title VII, which provides 
procedures for targeting non-U.S. persons who are abroad, became known to the public following 
reports in the media beginning in summer 2013. According to a partially declassified 2011 
opinion from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), the National Security Agency 
(NSA) collected 250 million Internet communications per year under Section 702. Of these 
communications, 91% were acquired “directly from Internet Service Providers,” using a 
mechanism referred to as “PRISM collection.” The other 9% were acquired through what NSA 
calls “upstream collection,” meaning acquisition while Internet traffic is in transit from one 
unspecified location to another.
In 2015, Congress enacted the USA FREEDOM Act (P.L. 114-23) to reauthorize and amend 
various portions of FISA. While most of the amendments dealt with portions of FISA that were 
unrelated to Section 702, the act did include authority to continue surveillance of a non-U.S. 
person for 72 hours after the target is reasonably believed to be within the United States, but only 
if a lapse in surveillance of the target would pose a threat of death or serious bodily harm. A 
traditional FISA order for electronic surveillance must be obtained to continue surveillance after 
that period.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XX8K3ETH,2016-04-13,Edward C. Liu,,,2024-01-11T15:48:21Z,['28B8SB3Y']
1414,Intelligence Community Whistleblower Provisions,Report,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45345,"Intelligence community (IC) whistleblowers are employees or contractors of the federal 
government working in any of the 18 elements of the IC who disclose their reasonable belief of a
violation of law, rule, or regulation; gross mismanagement; waste of resources; abuse of 
authority; or a substantial danger to public health and safety. The Director of National 
Intelligence (DNI) whistleblowing policy and guidance generally are publicly available, and
address the process for making protected disclosures and identify whistleblower protections for 
IC contractors, members of the Armed Forces, and federal IC employees.
IC whistleblower protections have evolved in response to perceptions of gaps that some observers argued left these 
whistleblowers vulnerable to reprisal. The first whistleblower legislation specific to the IC, enacted in 1998, was limited to 
specifying a process for IC whistleblowers to make a complaint but offered no specific protections. Subsequent legislation, 
enacted in 2010, included general provisions for protecting IC whistleblowers, with no additional guidance on standards for 
implementation. Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19, signed in 2012, provided the first specific protections against 
reprisal actions for making a complaint. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (P.L. 113-126) codified 
these provisions, which were further supported by IC implementation policy. In early 2018, Congress passed legislation to 
address perceived gaps in protections for IC contractors. Other provisions in Title 10 of the U.S. Code, along with DOD 
implementing guidance, provide protections for members of the Armed Forces, including those assigned to elements of the 
IC. 
The August 2019 whistleblower complaint by a member of the IC that led to the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump
raised additional questions among many in Congress about whether existing statutory protections are sufficient. These 
questions concerned (1) whether whistleblowers should have a right to remain anonymous, and, if so, what, if any, recourse 
should they have in the event their identity is disclosed against their will; (2) whether procedures provide potential 
whistleblowers clear direction on how to approach Congress with a protected disclosure; (3) whether the text of the various 
IC-related whistleblower statutes is clear and consistent as they relate to each other; and (4) the final authority for making 
determinations of what constitutes a matter of “urgent concern.”
Since that time, Congress has taken steps to provide greater clarity and consistency to existing whistleblower legislation. The 
Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (Division X of P.L. 117-103), included, for example, a provision giving 
the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG) and Inspectors General of any IC element sole authority to 
determine whether a lawful disclosure constitutes a matter of “urgent concern.”
Effective whistleblowing protections are intended to instill confidence in the integrity and comprehensiveness of the process 
for submitting a complaint as much as for the process itself. By extension, when IC employees have confidence that they can 
make protected disclosures anonymously and without fear of retribution, they arguably are more likely to adhere to a process 
that is also intended to protect classified information. Conversely, this line of reasoning also suggests a lack of confidence
can increase the chances of wrongdoing going unreported or of classified information being compromised through an 
employee making a complaint outside of proper channels.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9VCVQ2Q2,2022-06-15,Michael E. DeVine,,,2024-01-11T15:12:22Z,['RHJFPRAI']
1415,Covert Action and Clandestine Activities of the Intelligence Community: Selected Congressional Notification Requirements,Report,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45191,"Section 3091 of Title 50, U.S. Code requires the President of the United States to ensure that the 
congressional intelligence committees are “kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence 
activities of the United States, including any significant anticipated intelligence activity,” 
significant intelligence failures, illegal intelligence activities, and financial intelligence activities.
In fulfilling this statutory requirement, the President must notify Congress of all covert actions
and significant clandestine activities of the Intelligence Community (IC). Congress’s interest in 
being kept informed of these activities originated from instances in the 1970s when media 
disclosure of past intelligence abuses during times of relatively limited congressional oversight
underscored the importance of Congress taking a more active role. Over time, these notification 
requirements were written into statute or became customary. 
Covert action is codified in Title 50, U.S. Code as an intelligence activity or activities of the 
United States Government to influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where 
it is intended that the role of the United States will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly. The 
term clandestine describes a methodology used for a range of sensitive intelligence and military 
activities—conducted under Title 50 or Title 10 U.S. Code authority—in which the activity itself, 
as well as U.S. sponsorship, is secret. Congress’s particular interest in these activities is, in part, 
due to the characteristics that they have in common: they involve particularly sensitive sources 
and methods, have significant implications for U.S. foreign relations, and incur serious risk of 
damage to U.S. national security or loss of life in the event of exposure or compromise.
Different committees exercise oversight jurisdiction depending upon how a particular activity is 
defined and the statutory authority under which it is conducted. Most intelligence activities, to 
include covert action, are authorized under Title 50, U.S. Code. Title 10, U.S. Code provides 
authorities for the military, to include clandestine activities of the military.
The President and intelligence committees are responsible for establishing the procedures for 
notification, which are generally to be done in writing. Partly in deference to this higher standard, 
such notifications are sometimes limited to specific subgroups of Members of the Senate and the 
House of Representatives in certain circumstances, as defined by law and custom.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VBP5W62B,2023-07-10,Michael E. DeVine,,,2024-01-11T15:09:05Z,['B6RJNLTK']
1416,"United States Foreign Intelligence  Relationships: Background, Policy and Legal  Authorities, Risks, Benefits",Report,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45720,"From its inception, the United States Intelligence Community (IC) has relied on close relations 
with foreign partners. These relationships often reflect mutual security interests and the trust each 
side has of the other’s credibility and professionalism. They are generally strategic and cover a 
range of national security priorities involving national defense, emerging threats, 
counterterrorism, counter-proliferation, treaty compliance, cybersecurity, economic and financial security, counter-narcotics, 
and piracy.
U.S. intelligence relations with foreign counterparts offer a number of benefits: indications and warning of an attack, 
expanded geographic coverage, corroboration of national sources, accelerated access to a contingency area, and a diplomatic 
backchannel. They also present risks of compromise due to poor security, espionage, geopolitical turmoil, manipulation to 
influence policy, incomplete vetting of foreign sources, over-reliance on a foreign partner’s intelligence capabilities, and 
concern over a partner’s potentially illegal or unethical tradecraft. Because intelligence failures involving a foreign partner 
sometimes become public, the risks to the IC of cooperating with a foreign intelligence service are more easily understood.
Nevertheless, the persistent cultivation of intelligence relations with foreign partners suggests that the IC remains confident
that the benefits outweigh the risks. 
These benefits are not always widely recognized due to their sensitivity and the potential for compromising the scope and 
details of what amounts to intelligence collection. The best known of these intelligence relationships are the decades-long ties 
to America’s closest allies, who have shared history, values, and similar perspectives on national security threats. Such ties 
are often one component of a broader security cooperation arrangement. Less well known are liaison relationships with U.S. 
adversaries over a particular issue of mutual concern, or relations with non-state foreign intelligence organizations such as 
Kurdish groups. Regardless of the partner, the U.S. Intelligence Community’s aim is to enhance national intelligence
resources and capabilities and to further U.S. national security by better understanding the threat environment and thereby 
enabling informed strategic planning, better policy decisions, and successful military operations. Thus, U.S. foreign 
intelligence relationships can be an overlooked component of public discussion of various aspects of international
cooperation.
Foreign intelligence agencies with ties to U.S. intelligence have often escaped the reach of congressional oversight. Yet 
Congress, at various times, has been interested in both the benefits and the risks of foreign intelligence relationships to U.S.
national security. While sometimes extolling the value intelligence foreign partners can provide, Congress has also been 
critical of occasions when the IC has become too dependent on such partners at the expense of IC investment in its own 
intelligence capabilities. Congress has also been concerned with the IC’s ability to independently assess the credibility of 
foreign intelligence sources, as well as the vulnerability of a foreign intelligence partner’s telecommunications infrastructure 
to compromise by a hostile foreign intelligence service. Of particular sensitivity to Congress has been the poor record of
human rights by certain foreign intelligence agencies and the potential for foreign intelligence partners to collect and share 
with the United States information on U.S. persons.

1417,Intelligence Community Diversity and Equal Opportunity,Report,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46629,"This report looks at the history of congressional and presidential concerns about a lack 
of diversity in the intelligence community (IC), offers some of the data available, and 
examines selected policies, practices, and programs that are intended to achieve greater 
diversity and equal opportunity in the intelligence community.
In the late 1980s, U.S. Representative Louis Stokes of Ohio, the only African American 
ever to serve as chairman of an intelligence committee, singled out diversity in the 
intelligence community as an issue of operational concern. Since Representative Stokes’ 
initial efforts, the intelligence committees have addressed diversity in the intelligence 
community through hearings, legislation, and reporting requirements.
In 2002, Congress expressed its views on IC diversity by legislating a sense of Congress that the intelligence 
agencies should make the creation of a more diverse workforce a priority in hiring decisions and should increase 
their minority recruitment efforts through their undergraduate training programs.
In 2003, Congress found that the intelligence community “has a significantly lower percentage of women and 
minorities than the total workforce of the Federal government and the total civilian labor force.” It also found that 
“women and minorities continue to be under-represented in senior grade levels, and in core mission areas, of the 
intelligence community.”
The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires the intelligence community to prescribe 
personnel policies and programs that ensure its personnel “are sufficiently diverse for purposes of the collection 
and analysis of intelligence through the recruitment and training of women, minorities, and individuals with 
diverse ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds.” 
The intelligence community has used varying definitions of diversity in recent years, but the most authoritative 
definition is now found in law. The FY2020 Intelligence Authorization Act defines this term for the community as
“diversity of persons based on gender, race, ethnicity, disability status, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender 
identity, national origin, and other demographic categories.”
With the publication of the unclassified annual intelligence community demographic reports since 2016, some IC 
diversity information is now available each year, but it provides only an amalgamation of demographic 
percentages. The unclassified reports do not include demographic data for each element or specific data on the 
number of people entering, remaining, or leaving an element. More detailed data and information would be 
required to identify the sex, race, and ethnicity composition of each intelligence community element’s workforce 
and its longitudinal changes.
“Over its long history, the intelligence community has been challenged in its efforts to increase the representation 
of minorities, women, and persons with disabilities.” This was the message from the Director of National 
Intelligence to the intelligence community in a memorandum included with the publication of the 2017 
intelligence community barriers analysis report. Its goal was to determine why impediments to diversity and 
inclusion persist in the intelligence community.
Although the intelligence community has made progress since the period of the 1990s intelligence committee 
hearings on diversity in the community, its annual demographic data published from FY2015 to FY2018 suggest 
that its personnel policies, practices, and programs may require additional measures to achieve greater diversity
and equal opportunity.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HVB9ZCKL,2020-12-07,"Alan Ott, Sofia Plagakis",,,2024-01-11T15:06:04Z,['HCN8YFI8']
1418,Intelligence Coordination on Domestic Terrorism and Violent Extremism: Background  and Issues for Congress,Report,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47229,"This report provides an overview of the evolution of domestic intelligence activities by the 
intelligence and law enforcement communities, as well as the processes by which intelligence 
and law enforcement agencies coordinate their efforts and share intelligence on domestic 
extremist violence and terrorism. Congress, in its intelligence oversight responsibilities, has 
expressed interest in knowing that the intelligence and law enforcement communities are 
coordinating on domestic threats appropriately: sharing information in a manner that is timely 
and also protects civil liberties. 
When the term intelligence is used informally to describe a function of government—involving 
the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information in support of national security 
priorities—there is the potential for confusion over what it actually means, which agencies are 
involved, how coordination and intelligence sharing is conducted, and what legal authorities 
guide intelligence activities. This is especially true of domestic intelligence activities to counter 
the threat of terrorism and extremist violence in the United States.
The term intelligence generally refers to activities authorized under Title 50 of the United States Code (U.S. Code or U.S.C.), 
performed by the 18 statutory elements of the intelligence community, or described in guidelines for law enforcement 
organizations outlined in Part 23 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulation (28 C.F.R. §23), Criminal Intelligence 
Systems Operating Policies. Intelligence activities in support of efforts to counter the threat of domestic terrorism or domestic 
violent extremism can involve either agencies of the intelligence community or law enforcement. Domestic terrorism is 
defined in statute as “acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any 
State” and “appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; influence the policy of a government by 
intimidation or coercion; or affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping”; and take 
place primarily in the United States. Domestic violent extremism refers to violent criminal acts in furtherance of ideological 
goals stemming from domestic influences, such as racial bias and anti-government sentiment. 
The public has a reasonable expectation that, regardless of the activity or agency involved, officials conducting intelligence 
activities in a domestic setting will respect the privacy and civil liberties of U.S. citizens. In a domestic environment, the 
intelligence community must abide by the various oversight requirements established by Congress and the President, 
including Attorney General Guidelines and the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA, P.L. 
95-511), as amended.
At the same time, it is incumbent upon both the intelligence and law enforcement communities to share information in a 
manner that is timely and effective. The current structure for sharing information between the intelligence community and 
law enforcement agencies is a legacy of the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001 (hereinafter 
referred to as 9/11). To break down long-standing cultural barriers between intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and to 
enable more effective protection of the country, Congress included in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act 
of 2004 (IRTPA, P.L. 108-458) provisions to promote a culture of information sharing to mitigate the threat of international 
terrorism. The IRTPA also included provisions to strengthen oversight to try to ensure the intelligence and law enforcement 
communities, in sharing more information, do not overstep their authorities and violate civil liberties. Since 9/11, the 
domestic terrorism and violent extremist threat has evolved to increasingly include U.S. persons conducting attacks in the 
United States inspired by either foreign terrorist groups and ideologies, or domestic extremist ideologies or grievances. 
As the threat of terrorism and violent extremism has evolved, coordination between the intelligence and law enforcement 
communities has become more complex, and it remains a work in progress. Congressional action has focused on enhancing 
intelligence-law enforcement coordination and threat mitigation while trying to ensure oversight provisions are sufficient to 
protect civil liberties. This report is intended to assist Congress in its oversight responsibilities of the intelligence and law 
enforcement communities by explaining the respective roles and responsibilities of different agencies that conduct

1420,Russian Military Intelligence: Background and Issues for Congress,Report,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46616,"Following Russia’s occupation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and invasion of eastern Ukraine in 
2014, many observers have linked Russia to additional malicious acts abroad. U.S. and European 
officials and analysts have accused Russia of, among other things, interfering in U.S. elections in 
2016; attempting a coup in Montenegro in 2016; conducting cyberattacks against the World Anti Doping Agency and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2016 and 
2018, respectively; attempting to assassinate Russian intelligence defector Sergei Skripal in the 
United Kingdom in 2018; and offering “bounties” to Taliban-linked fighters to attack U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. 
Implicated in all these activities is Russia’s military intelligence agency, the Main Directorate of the General Staff (GU), also 
known as the GRU. 
The United States has indicted GRU officers and designated the GRU for sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine, cybercrimes, and election interference. The Department of Justice has indicted GRU officers for cyber-related 
offenses against the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, NotPetya 
malware attacks in 2017, various cyberattacks against the 2018 Olympics, and interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. The 
GRU as an agency has been designated for sanctions under Executive Order 13694, as amended, and Section 224 of the 
Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 (CRIEEA; P.L. 115-44/H.R. 3364 Countering America’s 
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act [CAATSA], Title II). 
The GRU is a large, expansive organization under the command of Russia’s Ministry of Defense and Defense Minister 
Sergei Shoigu. Headed since 2018 by Admiral Igor Kostyukov, the GRU plays an important role in Russia’s foreign and 
national security policies. As an arm of the military, the GRU is responsible for all levels of military intelligence, from 
tactical to strategic. The GRU commands Russia’s spetsnaz (special forces) brigades, which conduct battlefield 
reconnaissance, raiding, and sabotage missions, in addition to training and overseeing local proxies or mercenary units. 
Additionally, the GRU conducts traditional intelligence missions through the recruitment and collection of human, signals, 
and electronic assets. Beyond its traditional combat- and intelligence-related roles, the GRU conducts extensive cyber, 
disinformation, propaganda, and assassination operations. These operations are often aggressive and brazen, leading to 
publicity and the exposure of GRU culpability. 
Congress and the executive branch continue to consider responses and countermeasures to malicious Russian activities. 
Because the GRU continues to conduct cyberattacks, election interference, assassinations, and disinformation, understanding 
the agency’s structure and the position it occupies in Russian foreign and security policy can help identify what the GRU is 
capable of and why it conducts particular operations. Understanding the GRU also offers insight into Russia’s wider use of 
cyber, disinformation, and influence operations and can inform broader discussions of potential U.S. responses and 
countermeasures.
This report addresses Russian military intelligence, including organizational structure and activities, and related U.S. policy.

1421,Behind the Lawrence Legend: The Forgotten Few Who Shaped the Arab Revolt,Book,,"T. E. Lawrence became world-famous as 'Lawrence of Arabia', after helping Sherif Hussein of Mecca gain independence from Turkey during the Arab Revolt of 1916-18. His achievements, however, would have been impossible without the unsung efforts of a forgotten band of fellow officers and spies. This groundbreaking account by Philip Walker interweaves the compelling stories of Colonel Cyril Wilson and a colourful supporting cast with the narrative of Lawrence and the desert campaign. These men's lost tales provide a remarkable and fresh perspective on Lawrence and the Arab Revolt.  While Lawrence and others blew up trains in the desert, Wilson and his men carried out their shadowy intelligence and diplomatic work. His deputies rooted out anti-British jihadists who were trying to sabotage the revolt. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Lionel Gray, a cipher officer, provided a gateway into unknown aspects of the revolt through his previously unpublished photographs and eyewitness writings. Wilson's crucial influence underpinned all these missions and steadied the revolt on a number of occasions when it could have collapsed. Without Wilson and his circle there would have been no 'Lawrence of Arabia'.  Yet Wilson's band mostly fell through the cracks of history into obscurity. ""Behind the Lawrence Legend"" reveals their vital impact and puts Lawrence's efforts into context, thus helping to set the record straight for one of the most beguiling and iconic characters of the twentieth century.

This article looks at the interactions between the West German Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV) and Israel's Mossad in a multilateral liaison called the Club de Berne after the Munich Olympics attack in September 1972. The article shows that these covert links were a means to overcome the crisis and served different functions for each side. For the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), which had been severely criticized after giving in to terrorist pressure, the BfV tried to prove to Israel its value as a security asset. For Israel, the Club de Berne allowed Mossad to send a covert message that aimed to pressure the FRG into a no-negotiation line. For both, the agencies could build on preexisting relations based on trust in the Club de Berne, which helped with the normalization process after the crisis. Although diplomatic and domestic policies after the Munich attack are well known, the intelligence dimension has thus far not been explored.

As a result of this, they were generally not employed as intelligencers. With the onset of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, however, pragmatism began to trump polemic, and women began to be employed as spies and to create their own networks. Royalist she-intelligencers were more numerous and generally of higher social status than their Parliamentarian rivals. She-intelligencers had two primary advantages over their male counterparts: they were less likely to be suspected of espionage and, should they happen to be caught, they rarely if ever faced execution and were generally released after a short imprisonment. Ultimately, the prejudice that suggested that women were incapable of undertaking espionage activities rendered them invisible, both to their enemies and to subsequent historiography.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/QPGERC3Q,2023-11-13,Nadine Akkerman,Springer International Publishing,,2024-01-11T09:06:11Z,['DS3WDJUS']

The two agencies kept watch on a Soviet intelligence officer, Arthur Adams, who was living illegally in the United States and serving as Hiskey's control officer. Despite an extensive investigation, neither Hiskey nor Adams was ever arrested.

conceptualization, and teaching about the world of intelligence. Its
goal is to study the field of intelligence’s essence, activities, and
influence on the national security of the state and its decision-making
processes. Policymakers and political leaders have recognized the
increasingly significant role of intelligence in shaping policy and
decision-making processes. These developments and concerns
accelerated the academization of intelligence and gave the field
its due attention and prominence. As the demand for intelligence
practitioners increased, American and Western universities
responded to the growing need for formulating academic programs
and courses devoted to intelligence, which significantly accelerated
the academization of intelligence. The United States, the United
Kingdom, and Canada are at the forefront of efforts to academize
intelligence. In other Western countries, such as Spain, France,
and Germany, the process of academicization has been slower and
burdened by the darker roles played by the intelligence services at
certain points in history.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5HFEULDI,2019-05-01,"Kobi Michael, Aaron Kornbluth",,"Cyber, Intelligence, and Security",2024-01-11T07:22:46Z,['HCN8YFI8']

1430,Surprise Attack: Lessons for Defense Planning,Book,https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780815709299/Surprise-Attack-Lessons-for-Defense-Planning,"Long before Germany's blitzkrieg swept the West, European leaders had received many signals of its imminence. Stalin, too, had abundant warning of German designs on Russia but believed that by avoiding """"provocative"""" defensive measures he could avert the attack that finally came in June 1941. And the stories of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Korean War, and three Arab-Israeli conflicts are replete with missed opportunities to react to unmistakable warnings. Richad K. Betts analyzes surprise attacks during the mid-twentieth century to illustrate his thesis: surprise attacks occur, not because intelligence services fail to warn, but because of the disbelief of political leaders.

""""Although the probability is low that the United States will fail to deter direct attack by the Soviet Union,"""" Betts says, """"the intensity of the threat warrants painstaking analysis of how to cope with it."""" His own investigation of the historical, psychological, political, diplomatic, and military aspects of his subject heightens understanding of why surprise attacks succeed and why victim nations fail to respond to warnings. In discussing current policy he focuses on the defense of Western Europe and applies the lessons of history to U.S. defense planning, offering detailed recommendations for changes in strategy. Obviously some of the potential dangers of military surprise cannot be prevented. The important thing, he emphasizes, is that """"without forces that exceed requirements (the solution Moscow appears to have chosen), it is vital to ensure that what forces exist can be brought to bear when needed.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/CIJSUJI9,1982--09-01,Richard K.

In 1975 Oshima Hiroshi, Japan's ambassador to Berlin during World War II, died, never knowing that the hundreds of messages he transmitted to Tokyo had been fully decoded by the Americans and whisked off to Washington, providing a major source of information for the Allies on Nazi activities.

Resurrecting Oshima’s decoded communications, which had remained classified for several decades, Carl Boyd provides a unique look at the Nazis from the perspective of a close foreign observer and ally. He uses Oshima’s own words to reveal the thought and strategies of Adolf Hitler and other high-ranking Nazis, with whom Oshima associated.

In addition to providing illuminating insight into Nazi activities and attitudes—military buildup in North Africa, the unwillingness to accept a separate peace with the Soviets—Boyd illustrates the functions of MAGIC.

It was here that the new intelligence agencies fought their battles, each in pursuit of the other’s secrets. Both sides sent in their own agents, but they also hired local men and women to work for them, as couriers, trainspotters and infiltrators. Many of them were recruited from the shadowy criminal underworld and brought with them their own concerns; others sacrificed their lives for love of their country. Author Edwin Ruis has plumbed the depths of the international archives to bring to light the unexplored and often wellguarded secret histories of intelligence in the First World War. But even this is only half the story.

In the desperate fight against Nazi Germany, nothing is considered too outlandish, so the British secret services turn to figures from the occult world to help turn the tide of war. What begins as a mission to understand Hitler’s supposed astrological advice soon becomes more bizarre, with often hilarious, unintended consequences. It is a story of misinformation, false predictions and some of the most surreal secret operations of the Second World War. Incredibly, it is all true. Featuring an eccentric cast of characters, including the creator of James Bond, a cross-dressing astrologer, a spymaster who walked around in public with his pet bear and the self-proclaimed ‘wickedest man in the world’, best-selling author Nicholas Booth weaves together an amazing narrative of spying, sabotage and black propaganda. Using hitherto secret files – many only released in the last few years – Lucifer Rising unravels for the first time the myths surrounding these operations, culminating with perhaps the most curious of all: the arrival by parachute of Rudolf Hess in Scotland in May 1941.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/2CVUD5ZG,2016-06-06,Nicholas Booth,The History Press,,2024-01-10T17:35:23Z,['SCCGXHMZ']

In the course of his research, Robin Denniston has uncovered previously unknown files of diplomatic intercepts which show that Churchill's role in British foreign policy and war planning was far more signficant than has hitherto been supposed. Although neither a commander-in-chief nor a head of state, he personally exerted considerable influence on British foreign policy to force Turkey into the Second World War on the side of the Allies. This ground-breaking book explores Churchill's use of secret signals intelligence before and during the Second World War and also sheds fresh light on Britain's relations with Turkey - a subject which has not received the attention it deserves. The book examines a little-known plan to open a second front in the Balkans, from Turkey across the eastern Mediterranean, designed to hasten D-Day in the west, and reveals new information on the 1943 Cicero spy scandal - the biggest Foreign Office security lapse until the Burgess and Maclean affair some twenty years later.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GGKYASH2,2009-09-21,Robin Denniston,The History Press,,2024-01-10T17:34:07Z,"['T92JK7A5', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

The Air Corridors comprised three regulated airways for civil and military air traffic that connected West Berlin to West Germany. Operating under the guise of innocent transport and training flights, the pilots used their right of access to gather huge amounts of imagery for forty-five years.

Perhaps not the first place that springs to mind when considering the top-secret photographic interpretation that helped secure an Allied victory in the Second World War, but this was the headquarters of the Allied Central Interpretation Unit. It was here that air photography from all over enemy-occupied Europe was pored over by photographic interpreters, who sought out intricate details of enemy activity which then influenced virtually every Allied operation of the war.

These quick-minded men and women were the ones to find out where the infamous German V-weapons were being constructed, were the first to see the results of the Dambusters’ raid and were sworn to utmost secrecy on everything they viewed. Women made up half of this work force and were, unusually, treated as equals with their male counterparts: the best person for the job, regardless of gender.

But what motivated her to betray more than 100 members of the Interallié network, the largest spy network in France? Was she the only guilty party, or were others equally as culpable? Using previously unpublished material from MI5 files, Double Agent Victoire explores the events that led to her betrayal, who may have ‘cast the first stone’, and their motivations, as well as how the lives and careers of those involved were affected.

Created in the aftermath of World War II, the Central Intelligence Agency relied on women even as it attempted to channel their talents and keep them down. Women sent cables, made dead drops, and maintained the agency’s secrets. Despite discrimination – even because of it – women who started as clerks, secretaries, or unpaid spouses rose to become some of the CIA’s shrewdest operatives.

They were unlikely spies – and that’s exactly what made them perfect for the role. Because women were seen as unimportant, pioneering female intelligence officers moved unnoticed around Bonn, Geneva, and Moscow, stealing secrets from under the noses of their KGB adversaries. Back at headquarters, women built the CIA’s critical archives – first by hand, then by computer. And they noticed things that the men at the top didn’t see. As the CIA faced an identity crisis after the Cold War, it was a close-knit network of female analysts who spotted the rising threat of al-Qaeda – though their warnings were repeatedly brushed aside.

After the 9/11 attacks, more women joined the agency as a new job, targeter, came to prominence.

1467,Agent André: The German Jew at the heart of the SIS and French resistancec,Book,https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/publication/agent-andre/9781803993461/,"As intriguing and compelling as a work of fiction, the memoirs of ‘André’ Joseph Scheinmann mesmerize and enthral the reader. His true-life story of derring-do starts as a Jewish youth in Munich, then as an escapee by forgery from a prisoner-of war camp after the bitterly brief fight for France in the summer of 1940.

Undercover as a translator for the Nazis at the Brittany headquarters of the French National Railroads, for a year and a half he was a spy and saboteur for the British and Free French under his disguise as André Maurice Peulevey. Summoned by the British, he crossed the Channel by moonlight in kayak and motor-torpedo boat on a clandestine trip, underwent initiation and training as an MI6 agent in England, and was betrayed and arrested on his return to mainland Europe.

André then began an even more perilous trip through Gestapo prisons to the little-known Natzweiler concentration camp. With clarity of vision, he maintained dignity and morale among his bunkmates and ferociously dedicated himself to the continued sabotage of the German war machine from inside that camp. Later at Dachau and Allach, he organized theatrical events and continued to pull the wool over the eyes of his tormentors.

From youthful activism in the heart of Germany to the French Resistance, SIS, Gestapo prisons and concentration camps, André's story is an action-packed saga. A debonair young man in a broken world who remade himself as a cunning fighter for freedom, his insights and example give us a whole new perspective on espionage, the French Resistance, British Secret Intelligence Service, and surviving the Nazi war machine.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BY53I8VH,2024-04-25,Diana Mara Henry,The History Press,,2024-01-10T16:42:25Z,['SCCGXHMZ']

1475,Art of Deception: Dueling Intelligence Organizations in World War II,Thesis,https://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu%3A175857/,"Historical works analyzing the cause of Germany’s defeat, or the Allies’ success, in
World War II are certainly abundant. Although it is impossible to say that the use of
intelligence led to an Allied victory, it is nonetheless a fact that it greatly contributed to
that victory. From the Allies’ superior use of cryptology, to their masterful employment
of double agents, the Allies managed to outwit the Germans. This work analyzes the
development, implementation, and performance of the double-cross system in World War
II. It is argued here that the Allies, and specifically MI5 along with the combined forces
of the British military, government, and intelligence services, succeeded in outwitting the
Germans. Their success was not the result of German incompetence, but was due to the
superior quality of the British system.
 The first chapter explores the development of British deception and proves that those
early campaigns laid a solid foundation for the grand deception scheme of June 1944
(Operation Bodyguard). The second chapter discusses the development of the doublecross system under the control of MI5. Chapter Three analyzes the evolution and
operations of MI5’s German counterpart, the Abwehr. The final chapter is a case study
focusing on the career of Juan Pujol – the Abwehr’s most trusted and influential spy
(ARABEL) and MI5’s most effective double agent (GARBO). The study of Pujol
demonstrates MI5’s superior qualities as an intelligence organization; correspondingly, it
also proves that the Abwehr was simply outwitted by the British, not incompetent.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/KKIFIEW5,2004,Whitney Talley Bendeck,,,2024-01-10T16:01:50Z,"['RHJFPRAI', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

Dulles's The Craft of Intelligence. This classic of spycraft is based on Allen Dulles's incomparable experience as a diplomat, international lawyer, and America's premier intelligence officer. Dulles was a high-ranking officer of the CIA's predecessor--the Office of Strategic Services--and was present at the inception of the CIA, where he served eight of his ten years there as director. Here he sums up what he learned about intelligence from nearly a half-century of experience in foreign affairs.

In World War II his OSS agents penetrated the German Foreign Office, worked with the anti-Nazi underground resistance, and established contacts that brought about the Nazi military surrender in North Italy. Under his direction the CIA developed both a dedicated corps of specialists and a whole range of new intelligence devices, from the U-2 high-altitude photographic plane to minute electronic listening and transmitting equipment.

Dulles reveals much about how intelligence is collected and processed, and how the resulting estimates contribute to the formation of national policy. He discusses methods of surveillance, and the usefulness of defectors from hostile nations. His knowledge of Soviet espionage techniques is unrivaled, and he explains how the Soviet State Security Service recruited operatives and planted ""illegals"" in foreign countries. He spells out not only the techniques of modern espionage but also the philosophy and role of intelligence in a free society threatened by global conspiracies.

Dulles also addresses the Bay of Pigs incident, denying that the 1961 invasion was based on a CIA estimate that a popular Cuban uprising would ensue. This account is enlivened with a wealth of personal anecdotes. It is a book for readers who seek wider understanding of the contribution of intelligence to our national security.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/774DGDB4,2004-10-01,Allen W.

Yet despite the crucial importance of this issue, we don't know enough about how states and their leaders draw inferences about their adversaries' long-term intentions. Knowing the Adversary draws on a wealth of historical archival evidence to shed new light on how world leaders and intelligence organizations actually make these assessments. Keren Yarhi-Milo examines three cases: Britain's assessments of Nazi Germany's intentions in the 1930s, America's assessments of the Soviet Union's intentions during the Carter administration, and the Reagan administration's assessments of Soviet intentions near the end of the Cold War. She advances a new theoretical framework—called selective attention—that emphasizes organizational dynamics, personal diplomatic interactions, and cognitive and affective factors. Yarhi-Milo finds that decision makers don't pay as much attention to those aspects of state behavior that major theories of international politics claim they do. Instead, they tend to determine the intentions of adversaries on the basis of preexisting beliefs, theories, and personal impressions. Yarhi-Milo also shows how intelligence organizations rely on very different indicators than decision makers, focusing more on changes in the military capabilities of adversaries. Knowing the Adversary provides a clearer picture of the historical validity of existing theories, and broadens our understanding of the important role that diplomacy plays in international security.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/H49NU3UJ,2014-07-21,Keren Yarhi-Milo,Princeton University Press,,2024-01-10T15:49:29Z,['HCN8YFI8']

Saying that the estimate that identified the threats was either ""right"" or ""wrong"" ignores the probabilistic nature of intelligence assessments and the necessary subjective elements that make them useful to policymakers. By making this clear in the case of Iraq, we can separate the crucial question of how policy should be decided in the face of increased uncertainty and even more elusive enemies than have been faced in the past.

The previous phase of the Cold War (1947-1971), characterized by the intense systemic polarization between the United States and the Soviet Union, coupled with the expansion of state capacity and internal social conflicts within the US, contributed to the establishment of complex national systems of intelligence organizations and activities in both countries. In the 1970s, the strategic stabilization of US-USSR relations (détente) depended, in part, on the technological advancements in intelligence gathering from communications, signals, and imagery via satellites. Police and military surveillance of internal dissidents and the growing political crisis towards the end of the Nixon administration created the conditions for an unprecedented and consistent attempt to exert democratic external control over intelligence operations by the Legislative and Judiciary branches.

Within days of the war’s outbreak, European belligerents mobilized intelligence assets and secret diplomacy to compete for Latin America’s allegiances and resources. This intelligence war entangled all of the American republics and even Japan. Dreary consular offices from the Rio Grande to the Straits of Magellan were abruptly thrust into covert activities, trafficking in fugitives, running contraband and conducting sabotage. Revolutionary and counter-revolutionary movements, big oil, international banks and businesses were also drawn in.
Drawing on long-classified U.S. intelligence documents, this narrative of the Latin American intelligence war reveals the complexity and chaos behind the placid veneer of wartime Pan-America.

Both Germany and the United States misunderstood and incorrectly assessed Japanese aims and capabilities on the eve of World War II. German attachés generally overestimated Japanese potential for expansion on the Asian mainland, and in particular Japanese aims for expansion at the expense of the Soviet Union. American attachés generally underestimated the Japanese ability to wage war and misunderstood Japan's commitment to its affairs in China. As a result, both Germany and the United States misjudged Japanese intentions and capabilities in World War II, with negative consequences for each nation.
Attaché reports were the most important intelligence source for both Germany and the United States in the 1930's, and any attempt at characterizing the intelligence efforts of Germany and the United States in Japan must take these reports into account. This dissertation utilizes reports deposited at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. and at the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv Freiburg in Freiburg, Germany. While historical evaluations of intelligence efforts prior to World War II exist, there are very few studies pertaining to attachés, and this dissertation will be the first to attempt a systematic and detailed evaluation of the “ground-level” intelligence collected by observers such as attachés. This project should help, therefore, to fill a gap in the historical record by providing a clearer understanding of German and American intelligence on Japan prior to World War II.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/8KSQPZ2U,2004-01-01,William D.

Virtually unknown, however, is the work of the extraordinary community of scholars who were handpicked by ""Wild Bill"" Donovan and William L. Langer and recruited for wartime service in the OSS's Research and Analysis Branch (R&A). Known to insiders as the ""Chairborne Division,"" the faculty of R&A was drawn from a dozen social science disciplines and challenged to apply its academic skills in the struggle against fascism. Its mandate: to collect, analyze, and disseminate intelligence about the enemy. Foreign Intelligence is the first comprehensive history of this extraordinary behind-the-scenes group. The R&A Branch assembled scholars of widely divergent traditions and practices--Americans and recent European émigrés; philosophers, historians, and economists; regionalists and functionalists; Marxists and positivists--all engaged in the heady task of translating the abstractions of academic discourse into practical politics. Drawing on extensive, newly declassified archival sources, Barry M. Katz traces the careers of the key players in R&A, whose assessments helped to shape U.S. policy both during and after the war. He shows how these scholars, who included some of the most influential theorists of our time, laid the foundation of modern intelligence work. Their reports introduced the theories and methods of academic discourse into the workings of government, and when they returned to their universities after the war, their wartime experience forever transformed the world of scholarship. Authoritative, probing, and wholly original, Foreign Intelligence not only sheds new light on this overlooked aspect of the U.S. intelligence record, it also offers a startling perspective on the history of intellectual thought in the twentieth century.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VL2285RU,2013-10-01,Barry M.

The transformation of this relationship, wrought by the developments of the war and the national security concerns of the immediate postwar era, illustrates two important points. First, despite some similarities, the respective priorities of British and American authorities regarding their POW general officers differed significantly. British officials consistently interrogated and eavesdropped on all of their senior officer prisoners, primarily seeking operational and tactical intelligence to aid the Allied war effort. Once the war had been won, the operation was immediately discontinued. In sharp contrast to their British allies, the Americans initially had little regard for the value of Wehrmacht general officer POWs. Only after the success of the Allied invasion of Normandy did American authorities began to evaluate what, if any, role the generals in their custody might play in the reconstruction of postwar Germany. Second, following the German surrender, American authorities reconceptualized their German prisoner-of-war generals as potential “allies.” The needs of the war in the Pacific, American admiration for the German military model, and Western Allied fears of Soviet intentions transformed Washington’s relationship with Wehrmacht general officers in the immediate postwar era.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/8BMVP746,2013-11-20,Derek R.

Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, which humiliated the US and catapulted the country into the war, became the popular archetype for Japanese treachery. When the investigations of the Pearl Harbor raid held during and after the war revealed that the attack itself had been supported by a clever deception campaign, this only reinforced the stereotype. The Japanese had simulated radio traffic from their invasion fleet which falsely placed it in the coastal waters south of Japan, not headed north-west toward Hawaii. They had planted false clues to their own unpreparedness, such as sending Japanese soldiers ashore on leave just hours before their ships sailed. They had reinforced garrisons in Manchuria to suggest a northern target for their obvious military preparations instead of the true southern one, and they had prolonged their show of diplomatic negotiations in Washington.

Even more disastrously for historical research, there is good reason to assume that valuable information was never entrusted to, or was deleted from, the registry of any intelligence agency.

Though the threat of direct Axis invasion never materialized beyond the Egyptian Western Desert with Rommel's Afrika Korps, this did not limit the Axis from probing the Middle East and cultivating potential collaborators and sympathizers. These actions left an indelible mark in the socio-political evolution of the modern states of the Middle East. This book explores the infusion of the political language of anti-Semitism, nationalism, fascism, and Marxism that were among the ideological byproducts of Axis and Allied intervention in the Arab world. The status of British-dominated Middle East was tailor-made for exploitation by Axis intelligence and propaganda. German and Italian intelligence efforts fueled anti-British resentments; their influence shaped the course of Arab nationalist sentiments throughout the Middle East. A relevant parallel to the pan-Arab cause was Hitler's attempt to bring ethnic Germans into the fold of a greater German state. In theory, as the Sudeten German stood on par with the Carpathian German, so too, according to doctrinal theory, did the Yemeni stand in union with the Syrian in the imagination of those espousing pan-Arabism. As historic evidence demonstrates, this very commonality proved to be a major factor in the development of relations between Arab and Fascist leaders. The Arab nationalist movement amounted to nothing more than a shapeless, fragmented, counter position to British imperialism, imported to the Arab East via Berlin for Nazi aspirations.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BX7LD4C9,2013-11-30,"Youssef H.

Intelligence agencies would create electronic databases into which their products (often text, but sometimes graphics, images, and even videos) would be entered. Users would search these databases for intelligence relevant to their concerns, and then download this intelligence on to the users’ own computer, where it could be combined as desired with other intelligence products drawn from other databases on the same network. Printed intelligence reports would become increasingly rare, for compared to electronic databases they would be seen as slow to produce, slow to transmit, difficult and expensive to update, and less likely to find their way into the hands of the person who really needed the information.

These influences can have positive or negative effects, but they become enduringly pernicious when poor analyst/ manager relationships are systematized into a dysfunctional ‘culture’. The mechanics and significance of these relationships have received scant attention from academics and public policy commentators. The aim here is to describe and assess the relationship between analysts and their managers in the United States Central Intelligence Agency's Directorate of Intelligence (DI) in the 1980s and early 1990s. The CIA's culture changed markedly in this period from that of previous decades, which most external observers and CIA professionals consider generally effective at producing good analysis.

the focus of current discussions of intelligence arising out

The variables have been selected because they provide a holistic view of the authority, jurisdiction, and roles of the French secret services in operating without impinging on the rights of individuals or threatening the incumbent political system whilst being insulated from political abuse. These variables are also important in defining what is the French secret service in today’s world of transparency and accountability where many details about the secret services are open public knowledge and hence not secret. Utilising the variables shows the French secret services as different from military or police services even though they co-operate and operate closely with them. Language presents an issue when undertaking such an analysis. The word often associated with the organisations of state in France considered to be secret services is renseignement.

In 1939, when the Union of South Africa entered the war on Britain's side, the German government secretly contacted the political opposition, and the leadership of the anti-war movement, the Ossewabrandwag.

The Nazis' aim was to spread sedition, undermine the Allied war effort, and – given the strategic importance of the Cape of Good Hope sea route – gain naval intelligence. Soon U-boat packs were sent to operate in South African waters, to deadly effect.

With the Ossewabrandwag's help, a network of German spies was established to gather and relay back to the Reich important political and military intelligence. Agents would send coded messages to Axis diplomats in neighbouring Mozambique. Meanwhile, police detectives and MI5 hunted in vain for illegal wireless transmitters.

In this meticulously researched account, its activities and structure are described in detail, using original secret service documents. The main body of the book concerns MI6’s operations during the Second World War, and includes some remarkable successes and failures, including how MI6 financed a glamorous confidant of the German secret service; how a suspected French traitor was murdered by mistake; how Franco’s military advisors were bribed to keep Spain out of the war; how members of the Swedish secret police were blackmailed into helping the British war effort; how a sabotage operation in neutral Tangiers enabled the Allied landings in North Africa to proceed undetected; and how Britain’s generals ignored the first ULTRA decrypts because MI6 said that the information had come from a well-placed source called BONIFACE’. In this new edition, operations undertaken by almost all of MI6’s overseas stations are recounted in extraordinary detail. They will fascinate both the professional intelligence officer and the general reader. The book includes organisational charts to illustrate MI6’s internal structure and its wartime network of overseas stations.

The Missing Dimension: Governments and Intelligence Communities in the Twentieth Century. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1984. Ernest R. May, ed. Knowing One’s Enemies: lntelligence Assessment Before the Two World Wars. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984. General Eisenhower pointed out that the U.S. Army treated intelligence as a “stepchild.”’ This characterization applied to most countries, at least until the development of surveillance satellites and other technological marvels. Within the military, intelligence has been the “slow track”; aside from a few mavericks, officers were generally shunted into the area when they were deemed unfit for more important tasks. This is not surprising: the job of the military is to fight, and so positions that directly represent this function will have the greatest prestige . Foreign ministries, of course, carry out diplomacy, and so one might think that they would value intelligence more highly because of its closer links to this mission. But most diplomats have prided themselves on being generalists and have tended to believe, often correctly, that they can understand other countries better than can specialized intelligence officers. Furthermore , intelligence operators are often an unruly bunch, and intelligence operations, if discovered, create frictions between governments which complicate the lives of diplomats, as the recent ”Pollardaffair” has done between the United States and Israel. Top decision-makers are more likely to value intelligence. In World War 11, Churchill referred to code breakers as his hens because they brought him golden eggs.

Not only were many of the people involved rather peculiar characters, but efforts at both collection and analysis were unsophisticated and underfunded . To take the latter characteristicfirst, William Fuller notes that before World War I, the Russian military espionage office had ”a staff of only four to five officers . . . [who] were so ill-paid that they all had to take extra jobs in the St. Petersburg district.”2(The Russians, however, led the world in code breaking before World War I, and British successes in this area after the war owed much to Russian refugees.) A bit more support was available in European countries in the interwar period, but the British major who was appointed the chief intelligence instructor on the German army and POW interrogation at the start of World War I1 found the staff college library “scanty and out of date” and had to go to bookstores in Belgium for texts. Unfortunately, he planned his trip to Holland for May 1940.3 Many intelligence operations and much intelligence analysis was amateurish , especially in Britain and to a lesser extent in Germany-national stereotypes are not without some f~undation.~ When the new British recruit was sent to Prague in the 1930s to set up an intelligence network, ”he was given no training in the fieldcraft required for recruiting and running agents or in other forms of intelligence gathering. When [he] asked for tips on how to be a spy, he was told he could spend two or three weeks en route to Prague at Vienna where . . . one of the most experienced station chiefs . . . would give him on the spot training.”5Of course amateurism is not automatically bad, and professionalism does not always lead to effectiveness.

1552,The First Enigma Codebreaker: Marian Rejewski Who Passed the Baton to Alan Turing,Book,https://www.usni.org/press/books/first-enigma-codebreaker,"The history of Enigma is of interest to many researchers and authors on an international scale. The capture and unraveling of the most hidden secret of the army of the Third Reich that was decisive for the fate of one of the greatest armed conflicts in the history of the world appeals to everyone from the avid historian to Hollywood. So far, other authors' attention has focused on the technical and cryptological issues of Enigma functioning, the fate of the Bletchley Park facility, or Alan Turing's story. Most of the attention was devoted to the events during the Second World War and it is the time frame of this conflict that usually begins and ends the story of Enigma. 

The First Enigma Codebreaker raises an issue that has never been discussed in greater detail in both international and Polish literature, the story of Marian Rejewski. This biography answers the questions: in what conditions was the ""Enigma conqueror"" brought up, in what circumstances did he manage to decode the machine, what happened to him during the Second World War and why he never ended up in Bletchley Park, what price he had to pay for his discovery in the communist Poland and what he did to make the world know the true history of Enigma. 

This is the story of a man who made a revolution in cryptology, about the rivalry between man and machine, about powerful history affecting individual lives, and about the life of Marian Rejewski whose story is still waiting to be presented to the public.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/NH6V3RXE,2023-04-15,Robert Gawlowski,Naval Institute Press,,2024-01-10T00:16:42Z,['SCCGXHMZ']

Each examination delves into extensive case studies to establish not only foundational understandings of essential espionage principals, but also creates guidance for their practical application on both individual and governmental scales.

Deception is a basic tactic used by allies and enemies alike, but when both protagonist and antagonist ply the same trade, it is the master of the double-cross who comes out the victor. Turnabout and Deception examines how to turn the tables on an opponent and use their own deception against them. Through thirty-eight case studies, this monograph dissects the double-cross to reveal the psychological battle of wits at its core.

No matter how well crafted, however, there is always a chance that a deception will fail. But failure is not the end of a deception, and even failed deception operations can yield results. Turnabout and Deception pores over sixty more case studies to determine why a deception will fail, steps to prevent a failed operation, and how to turn that failure into a success.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VLKGKVRQ,2016-07-15,Barton Whaley,Naval Institute Press,,2024-01-10T00:15:04Z,['RHJFPRAI']

Brugioni, author of the best-selling account of the Cuban Missile crisis, Eyeball to Eyeball, draws on his long CIA career as one of the world's premier experts on aerial reconnaissance to provide the inside story of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's efforts to use spy planes and satellites to gather intelligence. He reveals Eisenhower to be a hands-on president who, contrary to popular belief, took an active role in assuring that the latest technology was used to gather aerial intelligence. This previously untold story of the secret Cold War program makes full use of the author's firsthand knowledge of the program and of information he gained from interviews with important participants. As a founder and senior officer of the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center, Brugioni was a key player in keeping Eisenhower informed of developments, and he sheds new light on the president's contributions toward building an effective and technologically advanced intelligence organization.
The book provides details of the president's backing of the U-2's development and its use to dispel the bomber gap and to provide data on Soviet missile and nuclear efforts and to deal with crises in the Suez, Lebanon, Chinese Off Shore Islands, Tibet, Indonesia, East Germany, and elsewhere. Brugioni offers new information about Eisenhower's order of U-2 flights over Malta, Cyprus, Toulon, and Israel and subsequent warnings to the British, French, and Israelis that the U.S. would not support an invasion of Egypt. He notes that the president also backed the development of the CORONA photographic satellite, which eventually proved the missile gap with the Soviet Union didn't exist, and a variety of other satellite systems that detected and monitored problems around the world.

Long a desire of military commanders, the ability to see the terrain ahead and gain foreknowledge of enemy intent was realized when Chinese airmen mounted kites to surveil their surroundings. Kite technology was slow to spread, and by the late nineteenth century European nations had developed the balloon and airship to conduct this mission.

By 1918, it was obvious that the airplane had become the reconnaissance platform of the future. Used successfully by many nations during the Great War, aircraft technology and capability experienced its most rapid evolutionary period during World War II. Entering the war with just basic airborne imagery capabilities, by V-E and V-J days, air power pioneers greatly improved imagery collection and developed sophisticated airborne signals intelligence collection capabilities. The United States and other nations put these capabilities to use as the Cold War immediately followed. Flying near the periphery of and sometimes directly over the Soviet Union, airborne reconnaissance provided the intelligence necessary to stay one step ahead of the Soviets throughout the Cold War.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VZNP4LWG,2019-11-15,Tyler Morton,Naval Institute Press,,2024-01-10T00:08:09Z,['CZT6L9T7']
1560,OSS Operation Black Mail: One Woman's Covert War Against the Imperial Japanese Army,Book,https://www.usni.org/press/books/oss-operation-black-mail-0,"OSS Operation Black Mail is the story of a remarkable woman who fought World War II on the front lines of psychological warfare. Elizabeth “Betty” P. McIntosh spent eighteen months serving in the Office of Strategic Services in what has been called the “forgotten theater,” China-Burma-India, where she met and worked with characters as varied as Julia Child and Ho Chi Minh. Her craft was black propaganda, and her mission was to demoralize the enemy through prevarication and deceit, and ultimately, convince him to surrender. Betty and her crew ingeniously obtained and altered personal correspondence between Japanese soldiers and their families on the home islands of Japan. She also ordered the killing of a Japanese courier in the jungles of Burma to plant a false surrender order in his mailbag.
By the time Betty flew the Hump from Calcutta to China, she was acting head of the Morale Operations branch for the entire theater, overseeing the production of thousands of pamphlets and radio scripts, the generation of fiendishly clever rumors, and the printing of a variety of faked Japanese, Burmese, and Chinese newspapers. Her strategy involved targeting not merely the Japanese soldier but the man within: the son, the husband, the father. She knew her work could ultimately save lives, but never lost sight of the fact that her propaganda was a weapon and her intended target the enemy.

This is not a typical war story. The only beaches stormed are the minds of an invisible enemy. Often a great deal of time and effort was expended in conception and production, and rarely was it known if even a shred reached the hands of the intended recipient. The process was opaque on both ends: the origin of a rumor or radio broadcast obscured, the target elusive. For Betty and her friends, time on the “front lines” of psychological warfare in China-Burma-India rushed by in a cascade of creativity and innovation, played out on a stage where a colonial world was ending and chaos awaited.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GCAPD9MG,2020-08-15,Ann Todd,Naval Institute Press,,2024-01-10T00:07:13Z,"['B6RJNLTK', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

1562,Circle of Treason: A CIA Account of Traitor Aldrich Ames and the Men He Betrayed,Book,https://www.usni.org/press/books/circle-treason,"While there have been other books about Aldrich Ames, Circle of Treason is the first account written by CIA agents who were key members of the CIA team that conducted the intense “Ames Mole Hunt.” Sandra Grimes and Jeanne Vertefeuille were two of the five principals of the CIA team tasked with hunting one of their own and were directly responsible for identifying Ames as the mole, leading to his arrest and conviction.
One of the most destructive traitors in American history, CIA officer Aldrich Ames provided information to the Soviet Union that contributed to the deaths of at least ten Soviet intelligence officers who spied for the United States. In this book, the two CIA officers directly responsible for tracking down Ames chronicle their involvement in the hunt for a mole. Considering it their personal mission, Grimes and Vertefeuille dedicated themselves to identifying the traitor responsible for the execution or imprisonment of the Soviet agents with whom they worked. Their efforts eventually led them to a long-time acquaintance and coworker in the CIA’s Soviet-East European division and Counterintelligence Center, Aldrich Ames.

Not only is this the first book to be written by the CIA principals involved, but it is also the first to provide details of the operational contact with the agents Ames betrayed. The book covers the political aftermath of Ames’s arrest, including the Congressional wrath for not identifying him sooner, the FBI/CIA debriefings following Ames’s plea bargain, and a retrospective of Ames the person and Ames the spy. It is also the compelling story of two female agents, who overcame gender barriers and succeeded in bringing Ames to justice in a historically male-oriented organization. Now retired from the CIA, Grimes and Vertefeuille are finally able to tell this inside story of the CIA’s most notorious traitor and the men he betrayed.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/2ISN4RI6,2013-11-15,"Sandra Grimes, Jeanne Vertefeuille",Naval Institute Press,,2024-01-10T00:04:56Z,['RHJFPRAI']
1563,Joe Rochefort's War: The Odyssey of the Codebreaker Who Outwitted Yamamoto at Midway,Book,https://www.usni.org/press/books/joe-rocheforts-war,"Elliot Carlson’s award-winning biography of Capt. Joe Rochefort is the first to be written about the officer who headed Station Hypo, the U.S. Navy’s signals monitoring and cryptographic intelligence unit at Pearl Harbor, and who broke the Japanese navy’s code before the Battle of Midway. The book brings Rochefort to life as the irreverent, fiercely independent, and consequential officer that he was. Readers share his frustrations as he searches in vain for Yamamoto’s fleet prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, but share his joy when he succeeds in tracking the fleet in early 1942 and breaks the code that leads Rochefort to believe Yamamoto’s invasion target is Midway. His conclusions, bitterly opposed by some top Navy brass, are credited with making the U.S. victory possible and helping to change the course of the war. The author tells the story of how opponents in Washington forced Rochefort’s removal from Station Hypo and denied him the Distinguished Service Medal recommended by Admiral Nimitz. In capturing the interplay of policy and personality and the role played by politics at the highest levels of the Navy, Carlson reveals a side of the intelligence community seldom seen by outsiders.
For a full understanding of the man, Carlson examines Rochefort’s love-hate relationship with cryptanalysis, his adventure-filled years in the 1930s as the right-hand man to the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Fleet, and his return to codebreaking in mid-1941 as the officer in charge of Station Hypo. He traces Rochefort’s career from his enlistment in 1918 to his posting in Washington as head of the Navy’s codebreaking desk at age twenty-five, and beyond. In many ways a reinterpretation of Rochefort, the book makes clear the key role his codebreaking played in the outcome of Midway and the legacy he left of reporting actionable intelligence directly to the fleet. An epilogue describes efforts waged by Rochefort’s colleagues to obtain the medal denied him in 1942—a drive that finally paid off in 1986 when the medal was awarded posthumously.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/LT2SM2CN,2013-09-15,Elliot Carlson,Naval Institute Press,,2024-01-10T00:04:01Z,['SCCGXHMZ']

1565,The Liberation of Marguerite Harrison: America's First Female Foreign Intelligence Agent,Book,https://www.usni.org/press/books/liberation-marguerite-harrison,"In September 1918, World War I was nearing its end when Marguerite E. Harrison, a thirty-nine-year-old Baltimore socialite, wrote to the head of the U.S. Army’s Military Intelligence Division (MID) asking for a job. The director asked for clarification. Did she mean a clerical position? No, she told him. She wanted to be a spy.

Harrison, a member of a prominent Baltimore family, usually got her way. She had founded a school for sick children and wangled her way onto the staff of the Baltimore Sun. Fluent in four languages and knowledgeable of Europe, she was confident she could gather information for the U.S. government. The MID director agreed to hire her, and Marguerite Harrison became America’s first female foreign intelligence officer.

For the next seven years, she traveled to the world’s most dangerous places—Berlin, Moscow, Siberia, and the Middle East—posing as a writer and filmmaker in order to spy for the U.S. Army and U.S. Department of State. With linguistic skills and knack for subterfuge, Harrison infiltrated Communist networks, foiled a German coup, located American prisoners in Russia, and probably helped American oil companies seeking entry into the Middle East. Along the way, she saved the life of King Kong creator Merian C. Cooper, twice survived imprisonment in Russia, and launched a women’s explorer society whose members included Amelia Earhart and Margaret Mead.

As incredible as her life was, Harrison has never been the subject of a published book-length biography. Past articles and chapters about her life relied heavily on her autobiography published in 1935, which omitted and distorted key aspects of her espionage career. Elizabeth Atwood draws on newly discovered documents in the U.S. National Archives, as well as Harrison’s prison files in the archives of the Russian Federal Security Bureau in Moscow, Russia. Although Harrison portrayed herself as a writer who temporarily worked as a spy, this book documents that Harrison’s espionage career was much more extensive and important than she revealed. She was one of America’s most trusted agents in Germany, Russia and the Middle East after World War I when the United States sought to become a world power.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ESBK6FX9,2020-09-15,Elizabeth Atwood,Naval Institute Press,,2024-01-10T00:00:59Z,"['BNPYHVD4', 'MP7FJ9UA']"

Both were suffering the effects of A-234, a third-generation Russian-manufactured military grade Novichok nerve agent.
Codenamed FORTHWITH, Sergei was betrayed in December 2001. Arrested in 2004, he was convicted of high treason in Russia, but was subsequently included in a prisoner swap in July 2010 and brought to the UK. The journey to the attempt on his life had begun.

The Vienna spy swap was the culmination of a CIA plan to free a specific individual, Gennadi Vasilenko, who had been the Agency’s key mole inside the KGB since March 1979. To acquire the necessary leverage, the FBI swooped on a large network in the United States, ending a surveillance operation, codenamed GHOST STORIES, that lasted ten years. Anxious to avoid further embarrassment over the arrests, Vladimir Putin personally authorized an exchange, unaware of Vasilenko’s true status. It was only after the transaction had been completed, and two further Russian spies were exfiltrated from Moscow, that the Kremlin learned of Vasilenko’s value, and the scale of the deception.

1568,Dorwart's History of the Office of Naval Intellige,Book,https://www.usni.org/press/books/dorwarts-history-office-naval-intellige,"This refreshingly impartial history of the Office of Naval Intelligence is important both because ONI was the first official American intelligence agency and because very little has been written on the history of U.S. intelligence in the days before the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Jeffery Dorwart outlines the role of ONI in the development of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century naval, political, and diplomatic policies. He reveals that one of the primary motivations for establishing the agency was the burning conviction of a group of young and enthusiastic men that if the U.S. Navy was to meet the challenge of potential enemies, it had to be thoroughly informed about foreign navies. Not only does Dr. Dorwart show the impact of these vigorous personalities on their era--men such as Theodore Roosevelt, Richard Wainwright, John G. Walker, and William S. Sims--but he makes them come alive with remarkable clarity.

More than forty years before the scandal of ""Watergate"" shocked the world, an equally illegal entry of private property for political purposes was carried out by a government agent under instructions from the White House. Several years later, a fellow agent formed a top-secret spy ring for the personal use of the president of the United States. Meanwhile, others working for the same organization broke into safes, eaves­dropped, vandalized private property, and consorted with unsavory characters in the pursuit of domestic pacifists and radicals. Still others interfered in the internal affairs of Latin American nations, dabbled in Asian politics, and accompanied Fascist Black Shirts into Africa. These were U.S. naval and marine officers who became attached to ONI between 1919 and 1945.

In a scholarly style that mixes history with biography, this book documents the inner dynamics of ONI and its interaction with other segments of the navy and the government. While Dr. Dorwart relates its successes, he does not ignore the failures, limitations, and extra-legal tendencies of this vitally important but flawed organization.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/TNI34U9W,2019-12-15,Jeffrey M.

1569,"The Zimmermann Telegram: Intelligence, Diplomacy, and America's Entry into World War I",Book,https://www.usni.org/press/books/zimmermann-telegram,"By the winter of 1916/17, World War I had reached a deadlock. While the Allies commanded greater resources and fielded more soldiers than the Central Powers, German armies had penetrated deep into Russia and France, and tenaciously held on to their conquered empire. Hoping to break the stalemate on the western front, the exhausted Allies sought to bring the neutral United States into the conflict.
A golden opportunity to force American intervention seemed at hand when British naval intelligence intercepted a secret telegram detailing a German alliance offer to Mexico. In it, Berlin’s foreign secretary, Arthur Zimmermann, offered his country’s support to Mexico for re-conquering “the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona” in exchange for a Mexican attack on the United States, should the latter enter the war on the side of the Allies. The British handed a copy of the Telegram to the American government, which in turn leaked it to the press. On March 1, 1917, the Telegram made headline news across the United States, and five weeks later, America entered World War I.

Based on an examination of virtually all available German, British, and U.S. government records, this book presents the definitive account of the Telegram and questions many traditional views on the origins, cryptanalysis, and impact of the German alliance scheme. While the Telegram has often been described as the final step in a carefully planned German strategy to gain a foothold in the western hemisphere, this book argues that the scheme was a spontaneous initiative by a minor German foreign office official, which gained traction only because of a lack of supervision and coordination at the top echelon of the German government. On the other hand, the book argues, American and British secret services had collaborated closely since 1915 to bring the United States into the war, and the Telegram’s interception and disclosure represented the crowning achievement of this clandestine Anglo-American intelligence alliance. Moreover, the book explicitly challenges the widely accepted notion that the Telegram’s publication in the U.S. press rallied Americans for war.

Research that shows not only how Britain recruited Kopkow, but also protected him from prosecution as a war criminal

Historically rich in detail with photographs of many of the characters involved

On 27 May 1942, SS-General Reinhard Heydrich was assassinated by Czech agents who were trained in the UK and dropped by parachute into Czechoslovakia. Heydrich succumbed to his wounds on 4 June 1942. Two days later, Gestapo Captain Horst Kopkow’s department at Reich National Security headquarters was given fresh orders. From 6 June 1942 until the end of the war, Kopkow was responsible for co-ordinating the fight against Soviet and British agents dropped in Germany or German-occupied territories. This new direction for Kopkow made his name.

Within months, the ‘Rote Kapelle’ Soviet espionage ring was uncovered in Belgium whose traces went directly to Berlin and Paris. A new counter-espionage war began and agents caught would pay with their lives. In France and Holland, the Gestapo caught many SOE agents trained in Britain.

By spring 1944, around 150 British agents had been deported to concentration camps. By December 1944, almost all had been murdered without trial and Kopkow was directly involved in these murders. Arrested by British forces after the war, Kopkow was extensively interrogated due to his counter-espionage experience.

By 1941,the espionage activity and subversive potential of the large German expatriate community inPersia had become unacceptable to the British and the Soviets, leading them to invade andoccupy the country in August of that year. After the expulsion of the German diaspora, twoGerman intelligence officers continued active espionage and subversion operations as staybehindagents within the British zone. Their efforts were ultimately negated by the defeat of the SixthArmy at Stalingrad and the headlong retreat of Army Group South from the Caucasus. Theoperational planners in Berlin then changed their focus from subversion of the Persian polity tosabotage against the Lend-Lease supply route across Persia. Of fourteen special operations planned against Persian strategic targets in 1943 the Germans executed only three, all of whichfailed. The cause of such catastrophic failure was organizational and operational dysfunction atall levels of the two rival German intelligence servicesÑthe Abwehr and the Sicherheitsdienst(SD). Of equal significance was the robust British response to the Nazi threat, which resulted inthe capture of all German operatives on Persian soil and the elimination of any hostile threat tothe region. Particularly effective was the liaison between the Security Service (MI5) and theBritish security-intelligence authorities (CICI) in Tehran. Against all odds, German interest inthe region never waned: as final defeat loomed, the destruction of Persian targets became for theideologically motivated SD synonymous with the obstruction of postwar Soviet interests.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/T3R5J9MI,2012-06-01,Adrian O'Sullivan,,,2024-01-09T21:15:52Z,"['B6RJNLTK', 'SCCGXHMZ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

The book presents a fascinating case study of decision-making at the highest levels in the United States and Britain as their leaders planned to go to war in Iraq. Just as the Cuban Missile Crisis has been used for decades as a case study in good decision-making, the decision to go to war in Iraq will be analysed for years to come for lessons about what can go wrong in decisions about war.

The book presents a fascinating and truly comparative perspective on how President Bush and Prime Minister Blair took their countries to war in Iraq.

This book argues that cyber-espionage has come to have an uneasy status in law: it is not prohibited, because spying does not result in an internationally wrongful act, but neither is it authorised or permitted, because states are free to resist foreign cyber-espionage activities. Rather than seeking further regulation, however, governments have remained purposefully silent, leaving them free to pursue cyber-espionage themselves at the same time as they adopt measures to prevent falling victim to it.

Drawing on detailed analysis of state practice and examples from sovereignty, diplomacy, human rights and economic law, this book offers a comprehensive overview of the current legal status of cyber-espionage, as well as future directions for research and policy.

V. Jones, was approached by a staff member of Sir Henry Tizard's Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence. Britain was, in this period, ahead of most other nations in integrating the academic scientific community and defense research and development (R&amp;D), as illustrated by the lead that the Royal Air Force enjoyed in radar technology over the main adversary, Germany. However, as war drew closer, the Committee had experienced a problem regarding intelligence or, rather, the lack of intelligence: the British services simply were unable to collect material that might provide any insight into German efforts to apply science in aerial warfare. Jones was offered the task of looking into this problem and he accepted – by coincidence, agreeing to start his new job on September 1, the fateful day that Germany invaded Poland.Jones's experience underscores the central theme of this book. Our purpose in surveying the state of research on intelligence is not only to suggest promising topics or even to promote better understanding by academics and others of what intelligence does – although later in the chapter we assemble some of the research suggestions that derive from the assessments of the book's chapters.

The debate on the particular but related problem of politicization of intelligence has a shorter history. The phenomenon itself is not new. Before World War II, when intelligence was mostly collected by agents in the field, the fragmentary picture that resulted provided ample opportunity for policy makers to draw their own conclusions based on their own knowledge, fixed ideas, or prejudices. However, as intelligence during and after the war became a profession, with an increasingly sophisticated array of technical means of collection and analysis, the intelligence agencies and their products acquired a status which meant they could not so easily be bypassed in the policy-making process. In authoritarian regimes, this was not a problem; there, politicization permeated the entire intelligence process. Thus, for example, the KGB leadership in 1984 instructed its agents that their “chief task is to help to frustrate the aggressive intentions of American imperialism.”In democratic systems, however, the leeway for simply rejecting intelligence analysts' products in favor of policy-maker preferences became narrower. Policy makers then had to resort to other and sometimes more devious ways of bypassing intelligence that they did not agree with or that did not fit with their policy choices. Thus, politicization of intelligence became an issue.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BDWLZVLL,2009,Olav Riste,Cambridge University Press,,2024-01-09T20:52:26Z,['CGAXYI88']

On the positive side, it made it possible for the most advanced countries to get “an almost complete picture of the strength, deployment, and activity of foreign military forces.” The negative, for Agrell, was an overemphasis on what could be counted. Intelligence became “concentrated on evaluation and comparison of military strength based exclusively on numerical factors.”Yet, since the fall of communism and since 11 September 2001, research has not really asked similar questions about the impact of technical collection. To be sure, the highly classified nature of some collection makes it difficult for outsiders to judge the effects on policy outcomes. It is possible, however, to come to the kind of judgments Agrell rendered about the impact of technical collection on the practice of intelligence. So far, however, more serious research has not moved much beyond the post–September 11 conventional wisdom that the change in intelligence's target renders technical collection less effective. Terrorists, it is thought, are small and fleet – networked enough not to depend on large fixed facilities that can be monitored from space and nimble enough to shift to forms of communication, such as couriers, that cannot be intercepted by satellite systems.This chapter assesses research on technical collection, looking across the various “INTs” and, in particular, probing that conventional wisdom.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/KC6GXMGN,2009,Jeffrey T.

The intelligence community (IC) plays a central role in counterterrorism in at least three key ways. Counterterrorism relies on intelligence to (1) understand the threat, (2) give warning of adversaries' intentions and capabilities, and (3) find and disrupt the adversary. In these roles, intelligence provides counterterrorism forces with targets and opportunities to attack terrorist capabilities and processes, thereby achieving strategic objectives.Measuring the effectiveness of counterterrorism strategy is critical to the success of the strategy in order to validate the strategy and consequent resource decisions, to ensure the effectiveness of the plans and underlying action, and to provide policy makers with insight into whether counterterrorism efforts are actually making a difference. Here, the IC plays a fourth key role, in collecting, processing, and analyzing data required to assess effectiveness and providing planners with information necessary to establish “metrics” and measure strategic effectiveness. There are models of assessment that provide ways to measure strategic effectiveness that also provide insight into what is needed from intelligence.The nature of the terrorist threat, the demands of effective counterterrorism strategy, the role of intelligence in counterterrorism, and the need to measure strategic effectiveness all generate new requirements for intelligence.

Intelligence organisations or communities are also increasingly expected to achieve some sort of comprehension of a general situation and the course of specific events. In the best of worlds, this comprehension can be transformed into useful background analysis or warning – whether early or late, specific or general – that something is or might be developing in the domain that the intelligence service is expected to monitor. In the real world, lack of comprehension and, thus, of foresight is a common phenomenon, so common that it now constitutes the dominating theme of intelligence studies. Remove the failures and little is left of what is written about intelligence analysis and its use during the Cold War and beyond. Huge efforts have thus been expended to investigate and ponder why intelligence has been unable to deliver what was rightfully or wrongfully expected from it and to find solutions in terms of intelligence reform, often focused on reorganisation. This failure–investigation–reorganisation cycle has become something of a malaise of early 21st-century Western intelligence.A consensus has emerged on the necessity to transform intelligence and improve its ability to analyse and deliver foresight. However, neither reorganisation nor analytic training is a sufficient answer. The fundamental problem is the implicit model for knowledge production in intelligence systems that have been in place for more than a half-century.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3ZV5C8RP,2009,Wilhelm Agrell,Cambridge University Press,,2024-01-09T20:50:56Z,"['CZJ36V8L', 'WHBCJ8GW']"

During the last generation, various scholars have voiced impatience with the insightful but ad hoc pattern of studies in this new field and have called for research agendas oriented around cross-national comparisons. Such agendas, however, have not yet emerged. Various well-known factors help to explain this deficit of truly comparative analyses: the paucity of reliable, declassified data to analyze; the general lack of interest among government agencies in sponsoring such studies by in-house experts with access to the files; and the methodological divide between the academic historians (and their official counterparts) mining the available documents and their colleagues trained in political science who draw generalizations from the historical findings. Unfortunately, these perennial obstacles seem immune to quick or easy solutions. Another reason for the lack of comparative studies, however, is closer to home and perhaps easier to address: the lack of agreement, among both scholars and practitioners, of just what would be compared in a comparative approach to intelligence studies.A great amount of writing, and some excellent research, has been done on intelligence activities and personalities. Not so much has been done on the collective authorities, resources, oversight, and missions assigned to parties officially assembled to perform intelligence duties of particular nations. Still less has been done to compare these collectivities across nations, cultures, or eras.

As long as this discipline lacks a literature, its methods, its vocabulary, its body of doctrine, and even its fundamental theory run the risk of never reaching full maturity.Practicing economists and politicians, among others, are rightly critical of the remoteness of some academic research from the real world in which they operate. However, economics without economic theory and economic history, politics without political history and political science, would be what Kent forecasted intelligence would remain without an intelligence literature: immature disciplines.The public space left vacant by the slow growth of intelligence studies as an academic discipline was invaded by a generation of fantasists and conspiracy theorists. Intelligence thus became the only profession in which a fictional character is still many times better known than any real intelligence officer, alive or dead. That character, of course, is James Bond, who made his first appearance in Casino Royal two years before Kent's article on “The Need for an Intelligence Literature.” Bond films have since been seen and mostly enjoyed by a majority of the world's population.THE ABSENCE OF SIGINT, OR “NO SUCH AGENCY”Until the 1970s, the majority of the world's modern historians, political scientists, and international-relations specialists was so bemused by intelligence that it was ignored altogether.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/UBP2M5L2,2009,Christopher Andrew,Cambridge University Press,,2024-01-09T20:47:33Z,['KGU8VLSW']
1597,The Political Warfare Executive: a re-evaluation based upon the intelligence work of the German Section,Thesis,https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6022/,"Conventional interpretations regarding the role of the Political Warfare Executive during the Second World War have concentrated almost exclusively on the propaganda output of the organisation. The role of the intelligence sections working for and within the organisation have been largely disregarded or overlooked in the existing history of Executive. This thesis offers a re-evaluation of the PWE which includes this `missing dimension', specifically here the intelligence work of the German Section of the Executive. This approach widens the scope of enquiry to include an exploration of the links between intelligence and propaganda, subversion and sabotage and considers the importance of this relationship for the way in which the PWE emerged. The examination of the Weekly Reports of the German Section identifies a different `type' of intelligence which can be described as `social political' intelligence, which provided the British government with a unique view of the social and political conditions in Germany throughout the duration of the war. The thesis concentrates on the period after the announcement of Unconditional Surrender in January 1943 to the early months on 1946, when the personnel and expertise of the German Section were transferred to the Foreign Office. The analysis of the intelligence reports of the German Section is focussed on three particular issues of interest to government at the time and to historians today. These are German resistance and public opinion, British occupational rule, and the emergence of the perception of the Russian `threat' in Whitehall which signalled the beginning of the Cold War. Taken together these illustrate the way in which the PWE incrementally expanded it's activities over this period of time, and provide the basis for the re- evaluation of the Executive.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9PQT8G3P,1996,Pauline Elkes,,,2022-12-27T22:30:54Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

It reaches back only to the 1970s in the United States and to the 1990s in Britain. To be sure, there are some exceptions. The Netherlands established a specific parliamentary control in 1952; Germany (then West Germany) did so in 1956. France, one of Europe's oldest parliamentary democracies, passed its first extensive legislation in 2007.Parliaments, however, are not alone in checking on what intelligence services do. Primary responsibility for their proper functioning lies with the executive. Governments are politically responsible to parliaments and to the public for what intelligence does or fails to do. Yet, they face a difficult-to-resolve dilemma. Due to extremely tight security requirements, only a small number of government ministers and officials are in a position to monitor continuously and systematically the potentially most dangerous and most controversial intelligence operations. Because these are the same people who also give the orders, they are understandably reluctant to burrow deeply into intelligence failures of one sort or another. As a result, the most powerful oversight instrument is also the most unlikely to do the job rigorously. Typically, it takes an intelligence “scandal”, revealed by the press to the public, to get parliaments and executive overseers to act. In some cases, the judiciary becomes involved in pinpointing intelligence failure and forcing the executive to make needed changes.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5SPMYVUI,2009,Wolfgang Krieger,Cambridge University Press,,2024-01-09T20:46:04Z,['DVEM4H4W']

were attracted: former emigrants, those repressed or dispossessed, ideological opponents, criminals, and others. At the same time, a significant number of agents were recruited from the civilian population who remained 
in the occupied territories, especially from its most vulnerable categories (women and children). The recruited 
agents were used to carry out reconnaissance and sabotage missions, both in the rear of the USSR and in parts 
of the Red Army, and against the resistance movement. On the territory of the BSSR occupied by the Germans, 
sixteen training centers were opened where saboteur children were trained, and more than twenty were opened 
to train “agents in skirts”. Similar schools and courses were opened in Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic states. The 
Soviet secret services and partisan counterintelligence bodies were well informed about such work of the German secret organs. The performance of agents trained from among the civilian population was low. There were

And how could it have been otherwise, when they worked at the whim of a regime in the grip of “ignorant maniacs”? But what if, Robert Hutchinson asks, the worldviews of the intelligence services and the “ignorant maniacs” aligned more closely than these analyses—and subsequent studies—assumed? What if the reports of the German foreign intelligence services, rather than being dismissed by ideologues who “knew better,” instead served to reinforce the National Socialist worldview? Returning to these reports, examining the information on enemy nations that was gathered, processed, and presented to leaders in the Nazi state, Hutchinson’s study reveals the consequences of the politicization of German intelligence during the war—as well as the persistence of ingrained prejudices among the intelligence services’ Cold War successors

Closer scrutiny of underutilized and unpublished reports shows how during the World War II the German intelligence services supported widely-held assumptions among the Nazi elite that Britain was politically and morally bankrupt, that the Soviet Union was tottering militarily and racially inferior, and that the United States’ vast economic potential was undermined by political, cultural, and racial degeneration. Furthermore, Hutchinson argues, these distortions continued as German intelligence veterans parlayed their supposed expertise on the Soviet Union into positions of prominence in Western intelligence in the early years of the Cold War. With its unique insights into the impact of ideology on wartime and post-war intelligence, his book raises important questions not only about how intelligence reports can influence policy decisions, but also about the subjective nature of intelligence gathering itself.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/8N4X4CDQ,2019-01-01,Robert Hutchinson,University Press of Kansas,,2024-01-09T19:22:16Z,"['CZT6L9T7', 'SCCGXHMZ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

This article examines whether and how parliaments can be sites of politicisation, moving security from exceptional and technocratic politics toward more ‘normal’ democratic politics. Moving beyond the narrow focus on decisions over the use of military force, the examination focuses on the ‘hard case’ of parliamentary oversight of intelligence agencies and provides a case study on the German Bundestag. Overall, it finds that a strict divide between security and normal politics is overly simplistic, even when it comes to intelligence. There is evidence for politicisation that reveals patterns of normal politics through an increasingly institutionalised framework as well as public, increasingly controversial debates, including a good deal of partisan politics. However, debates tend to center on institutional and legal issues as well as symbolic skirmishes after specific events of high visibility, while many restrictions are deeply entrenched in parliamentary conventions and attitudes.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9Y85HJI7,2018-02-01,Hendrik Hegemann,,The British Journal of Politics and International Relations,2024-01-09T19:20:12Z,"['DVEM4H4W', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

However, there is also a long-standing bilateral tradition between the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany in this regard. Anglo-German intelligence and security relations have seen many ups and downs, but at the end of the day they have always proven to be effective in the right moment, with standing political crisis. Brexit means that the UK will be leaving the EU but not Europe – a simple fact often ignored in heated discussions. The UK will continue to share European security interests; she has to. Having said that, the current paper argues that current threats to national and EU security can in fact have soothing effect amid political turmoil around Brexit. The underlying argument is that common strategic interest is likely to lead to a cool-headed pragmatic approach. Intelligence and security relations, liaison and sharing, should, after all, continue to exist and not severely be affected by Brexit. It remains to be seen whether the UK will stay a permanent member of the respective EU security institutions; however, even if technically the answer is no, some sort of arrangement ensuring constant exchange is highly likely.

In the OIC operations room beneath the Admiralty, teams sifted through a combination of radar direction tracking information, secret reports of U-boat departures from the French ports, code-breaking from Bletchley, as well as information from the Americans and Canadians, often contradictory, to anticipate and counter the U-boat threat; and Sir Charles Rodger Noel Winn, in charge of U-boat tracking, who was said to be able to almost read the mind of Admiral Dönitz., the U-Boat commander-in-chief.

The Finnish Security and Intelligence Service prominently declares to be an expert in national security whereas no corresponding public territorial claim has been made by its counterpart – the Finnish Defence Intelligence Agency (FDIA). This observation leads to the question: are the tasks of the FDIA limited solely to the military defence of Finland or has it any more comprehensive role in safeguarding national security. This article aims to examine this question by comparing the provisions governing the purpose of civilian and military intelligence and analysing the provision on the targets of military intelligence. Legal analysis indicate that military intelligence targets are broadly located in the field on national security, both at the core of military activities and in the outer reaches on non-military activities.

This was achieved after the beginning of the German-Soviet war in June 1941. In 1943, the post where Umaszew worked was terminated, and he was transferred from Istanbul to Jerusalem. Around that time, the idea of using him in the activities of the “Promethean movement” emerged. However, no decisions were ultimately made in this regard.

Department I of the Interior Ministry cooperated with the First Main Directorate of the KGB in many fields. The basis for cooperation was the exchange of information and some of the documents obtained, which were mainly about political and economic issues. Scientific and technical intelligence was also an important field of cooperation. The security authorities of the Polish People’s Republic were not treated by the KGB as an equal partner.

The available archival records challenge the notion that Polish military intelligence was effective and conducted a long-term espionage strategy in Lebanon. In fact, since its establishment, the station lacked HUMINT capabilities and relied mostly on open source data. Moreover, the ambitious plans to set up a special intelligence post in Lebanon in case of the outbreak of a Third World War were hindered because of the civil war that started in 1975. Internal instability and bloody military conflict, however, enabled Polish intelligence to acquire significant amounts of Western-made weaponry, which boosted at the same time clandestine contacts with Middle-Eastern terrorist organizations.

However, it turns out that there were many other possible solutions. The “zero option” and “continuation” constituted two contradictory types between which there existed many more gradual forms. Their position was determined by such factors as: “the manner of breaking away with communism”, the level of the government’s experience and knowledge about the reform of the secret service, the involvement of the governing group in this field.

Following their country’s occupation by the German army, Sugihara provided Polish secret agents with Japanese or Manchurian passports and employed their services for his clandestine undertakings. The Germans, although greatly displeased with his activities as the same agents were working against them for the Polish government-in-exile and the British government, were indifferent to Sugihara’s attempts to rescue the Jews. Despite that German authorities were successful in arresting some of Sugihara’s spies, these measures were ineffective as in most cases the agents’ Japanese or Manchurian passports bestowed them with diplomatic immunity. After the end of Lithuanian independence Sugihara was forced to leave the country and was transferred to Prague ‒ clearly not an ideal place to observe the USSR. Therefore, he took over the newly established consulate-general in K&#246;nigsberg, modern day Kaliningrad, to gain intelligence on Germany’s preparation for war against the Soviet Union in 1941.

Drawing on his experience in intelligence reporting at the time, as well as on recently declassified U.S. documents and materials from Soviet, Polish, and other Eastern European archives, MacEachin contrasts what was known then with what is known now, and seeks to explain why, despite the evidence available to them, U.S. policy makers did not take the threat of a crackdown seriously enough to prevent it.

Illiberal elements incorporated into democratic governance have raised numerous concerns and official warnings from the European Commission.

Sie seien wichtig gewesen, um in den Jahrzehnten der nuklear unt- legten Systemkonkurrenz Informationen über den Gegner bereitzustellen, vor allem auch deshalb, weil das prekäre nukleare Gleichgewicht ganz besondere Beobachtung des Gegenüber notwendig erscheinen ließ. Literarisch wurde diese Konstellation vielfach beschrieben, wenn die Agenten beider Seiten zur Gewä- leistung sicherer Informationslagen für die Regierungen beider Supermächte und damit zur Sicherung des internationalen Friedens kooperierten. Nun aber, in einer Phase der anbrechenden internationalen Kooperation, die sogar vom Ende der Geschichte geprägt sein sollte, seien die Dienste überflüssig. Es kam anders, und zwar keineswegs überraschend. Denn mit dem Ende des Ost-West-Konflikts waren Politik und Staatenkonkurrenz keineswegs an ihr Ende gekommen. Und ganz im Gegensatz zu den damals gehegten Erwartungen einer stabileren und kalkulierbareren Weltordnung war zu beobachten, wie sich das Verhältnis von Wirtschaft und Politik verkomplizierte und wie sich immer mehr gesellschaftliche Akteure in der internationalen Politik nachdrücklicher bemerkbar machten. Dass kurze Zeit später in einer scheinbar von einem Staat dominierten Weltordnung asymmetrische Kampfformen wieder verstärkt auf- griffen wurden, trug zur Gewalttätigkeit und Komplexität der sich nun ent- ckelnden internationalen und transnationalen Ordnung wesentlich bei. [Foreword When the East-West conflict came to an end, an intense debate flared up for a short time in which the abolition of intelligence services was demanded because they were no longer needed in the changed international environment. They had been important for providing information about the opponent during the decades of nuclear-led systemic competition, above all because the precarious nuclear balance made very special observation of the other side seem necessary. This constellation has been described many times in literature, when the agents of both sides co-operated to provide secure information for the governments of both superpowers and thus to secure international peace. Now, however, in a phase of dawning international cooperation that was even to be characterised by the end of history, the services were superfluous. Things turned out differently, and by no means surprisingly. After all, the end of the East-West conflict was by no means the end of politics and competition between states. And in stark contrast to the expectations of a more stable and predictable world order at the time, the relationship between business and politics became more complicated and more and more social actors made their presence felt in international politics. The fact that a short time later, in a world order seemingly dominated by one state, asymmetric forms of struggle were once again increasingly resorted to contributed significantly to the violence and complexity of the international and transnational order that was now emerging.]",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3IG4UFIT,2009-06-11,"Thomas Jäger, Anna Daun",Springer,,2024-01-08T08:44:37Z,"['CK5MNYPQ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Accused of taking part in the intrigue, Quevedo had to flee disguised as a beggar was able thanks to his perfect command of the Italian language.

As Lowenthal grasped this relationship in his well-known definition, “intelligence is the process by which specific types of information important to national security are requested, collected, analyzed, and provided to policymakers.” (Lowenthal 2005: 8). Even though numerous experts sought to put forward more comprehensive conceptual proposals, interdependence between information, security and policymaking seems to constitute the axis of analysis, interpretation and revision of the very meaning (in definitional as well as operative terms) of intelligence. This assumption is particularly important in undertaking a study of an Intelligence Community in a country like Poland where the concept of security, the perception and assessment of threats as well as the organisation and functioning of intelligence services is to a large extent different from the biggest EU member states and requires adoption of a very peculiar stance.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/8THHLK2Z,2009-06-11,Artur Gruszczak,VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften,,2024-01-08T08:39:14Z,"['CK5MNYPQ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

This article seeks to redress this, and investigates the pivotal role intelligence played in the planning, preparation, and carrying out of Weserübung. The study examines the dearth of relevant information in the early planning stage; the subsequent accumulation of military assessments of Norway's defensive capabilities; the process of denying London and Oslo intelligence regarding Berlin's intentions; the significance of Danish and Norwegian airfields to the operation; and the importance of maritime reconnaissance and wireless intercepts in monitoring the disposition of the Royal Navy.

It was also a distinct era in Western intelligence collection. These were the years of the Germans. Mass interrogation in West Germany and spying in East Germany represented the most important source of intelligence on Soviet war-related science, weapons development and military capability until 1956 and a key one until 1961. This intelligence fuelled the arms race and influenced Western scientific research, weapons development, and intelligence collection. Using intelligence and policy documents held in British and US archives and records of the Ministry of State Security (MfS) of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), this book studies the scientific intelligence-gathering and subversive operations of the British, US, and West German intelligence services in the period to date. East Germany's scientific potential was contained by inducing leading scientists and engineers to defect to the West, and the book shows that the US government's policy of ‘containment’ was more aggressive than has hitherto been accepted. It also demonstrates that the Western secret services' espionage in the GDR was very successful, even though the MfS and KGB achieved triumphs against them. George Blake twice did appalling damage to MI6's spy networks.

German intelligence law distinguishes between certain categories of communications depending on the nationality and location of the participants. The provisions on the surveillance of foreigners abroad are far more permissive than those applying to the monitoring of communications that involve German nationals or foreigners in Germany. This differentiation is the consequence of a narrow interpretation by the German legislator of the personal and territorial scope of the right to privacy enshrined in Article 10 of the Basic Law. While there is no doubt that German nationals enjoy protection under Article 10 wherever their privacy is affected by the actions of the German State, current intelligence legislation is based on the understanding that foreigners are entitled to such protection only while staying in Germany. It will be argued that such discrimination is difficult to reconcile with German constitutional law because Article 10 protects every natural person without regard to nationality and because the Article's applicability is not limited to the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. This means that the BND is bound by Article 10 irrespective of whether its surveillance activities affect German nationals, foreigners in Germany, or foreigners abroad. Arguably, the level of protection in transnational constellations may be subject to certain modifications. But if basic rights protection is taken seriously, the existing fragmented legislation should be replaced by a uniform statutory regime for strategic surveillance of international communications that meets the minimum standards of Article 10 without bearing reference to a person's nationality or location.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6SWMR7EE,2018/07,Christian Schaller,,German Law Journal,2024-01-07T21:50:45Z,"['DVEM4H4W', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Hitler's most powerful foes were the Allied powers, but he also feared internal conspiracies bent on overthrowing his malevolent regime. In fact, there was a small but significant internal resistance to the Nazi regime, and it did receive help from the outside world. Through recently declassified intelligence documents, this book reveals for the first time the complete story of America's wartime knowledge about, encouragement of, and secret collaboration with the German resistance to Hitler?including the famous July 20th plot to assassinate the Fuehrer.The U.S. government's secret contacts with the anti-Nazi resistance were conducted by the OSS, the World War II predecessor to the CIA. Highly sensitive intelligence reports recently released by the CIA make it evident that the U.S. government had vast knowledge of what was going on inside the Third Reich. For example, a capitulation offer to the western Allies under consideration by Count von Moltke in 1943 was thoroughly discussed within the U.S. government. And Allen Dulles, who was later to become head of the CIA, was well informed about the legendary plot of July 20th. In fact, these secret reports from inside Germany provide a well-rounded picture of German society, revealing the pro- or anti-Nazi attitudes of different social groups (workers, churches, the military, etc.). The newly released documents also show that scholars in the OSS, many of them recruited from ivy-league universities, looked for anti-Nazi movements and leaders to help create a democratic Germany after the war.Such intelligence gathering was a major task of the OSS. However, OSS director ?Wild Bill? Donovan and others favored subversive operations, spreading disinformation, and issuing propaganda. Unorthodox and often dangerous schemes were developed, including bogus ?resistance newspapers,? anti-Nazi letters and postcards distributed through the German postal service, sabotage, and fake radio broadcasts from ?German generals? calling for uprisings against the regime.This is much more than a documentary collection. Explanatory footnotes supply a wealth of background information for the reader, and a comprehensive introduction puts the documents into their wider historical perspective. Arranged in chronological order, these intelligence reports provide a fascinating new perspective on the story of the German resistance to Hitler and reveal an intriguing and previously unexplored aspect of America's war with Hitler.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9BBBMMN9,1996,"Jurgen Heideking, Christoph Mauch",Routledge,,2024-01-07T21:47:38Z,['SCCGXHMZ']

The Americans assembled, supervised, and largely financed what is often referred to as the “Gehlen organisation,” named after its leader, former Wehrmacht general, Reinhard Gehlen, who was chief of the BND until his retirement in 1968. Whilst the existence of this co-operation had been known since the 1940s, largely due to Soviet subversion and propaganda, very little reliable information and virtually no original source material was available before the release of this, somewhat redacted, material in 2002 and 2007. This article provides a sketch of how former Wehrmacht officers, and even a number with an ominous SS past, who might well have been war criminals, came to work, first for United States military intelligence and, from 1949, for the CIA. It looks at some of their operations during those turbulent post-war years, which include the Berlin airlift and German rearmament in response to the Korean War.

The sole exception is found in the historical writings on East Germany between 1945 and 1990, where the Ministry for State Security - or Stasi - has become the subject of dozens of highly valuable studies. This neglect cannot be explained simply by pointing to the difficulties in getting access to relevant source materials. A more plausible explanation is found in the reluctance on the part of most German intellectuals to study the broader questions of war and peace in international politics. Military history has been marginalised in post-1945 German universities. The same is largely true of international security studies, defence studies, studies of insurgency, terrorism and various related subjects. Peace and conflict studies, a discipline established sometime in the 1970s, has mostly avoided both war or intelligence. The deeper reasons for this neglect lie both in Germany's psychological atmosphere and in academic politics. Spy novels and spy movies are as popular in Germany as anywhere but their heroes almost never are Germans. Even those German intelligence officers and spies who worked against Hitler and might therefore be regarded as heroes are barely known in present-day Germany. Those few scholars who are now trying to build up the field of intelligence studies get little help from their government or from private funders.

On the one hand, colonial state institutions defined themselves in opposition to indigenous networks of power associated with the pre-colonial period, whether based on ethnicity, tribal kinship or religious affiliation. On the other hand, few colonial states had sufficient bureaucratic substance to operate separately of indigenous society. This paper suggests that a more catholic vision of the parameters and purpose of state intelligence gathering may aid our understanding of how colonial states endured. These intelligence activities were multifaceted. They were designed, on the one hand, to provide sufficient information about local social organization to enable government to function. On the other hand, intelligence gatherers were also intelligence disseminators. Those same agencies of the colonial state that amassed information about indigenous populations also sought to control the movement of knowledge within local society in order to mould popular opinion, or, at the very least, shape the views of influential elites. Only then could local authorities set about influencing these differing forums of opinion to European advantage. In this sense, the paper argues, colonial states were ‘intelligence states’.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/8WB5SL5C,2005-12-01,Martin Thomas,,Journal of Strategic Studies,2024-01-07T19:28:07Z,"['MP7FJ9UA', 'SCCGXHMZ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Revisiting the roles and responses of the colonial security forces to what came to be known as the Sétif uprising, this article suggests two things. One is that the intensity of repressive violence pursued becomes more explicable once we consider the part played by political intelligence gathering in the operation of French colonial government in Algeria. The other is that the decision to use the political intelligence amassed before, during, and after the rebellion to coerce the Algerian population at the rebellion's epicentre signified a fundamental shift in the nature of the French colonial state in Algeria. Intelligence-led security policing, much of it later adopted by police agencies in metropolitan France at the height of the Algerian War, became more repressive, less selective, and highly violent.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/KTLGB244,2013-06-01,Martin Thomas,,Intelligence and National Security,2024-01-07T19:26:05Z,"['SCCGXHMZ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

After initially attempting to respect the traditional separation between military and political authority that had prevailed under the Third Republic, the role of the Free French secret services was progressively politicised by the exigencies of a clandestine war. Moreover, increasingly tense relations between certain leaders of the Resistance inside France and the leadership of the Gaullist secret services, along with preparations for the political reconstruction of France after the war, resulted in a war of successive decrees pertaining to the place of the intelligence services within the government hierarchy. The end result was that the secret services were placed under true direct civilian control. This marked a radical modification of the traditional system which had prevailed during the Third Republic. Free French leader Charles de Gaulle approved of this modification but never appeared to attach great importance to matters relating to the organisation and functioning of the intelligence services.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/N5353NK3,2000-12-01,Sébastien Laurent,,Intelligence and National Security,2024-01-07T19:25:37Z,"['SCCGXHMZ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Using a previously unexplored document from the archives of the French Foreign Ministry, this research note proposes another contribution of intelligence history to diplomatic history: By analysing national intelligence requirements – the ‘top secret diaries’ of governments – intelligence history can provide a window into the minds of decision-makers. The 1948 French plan de renseignement illustrates this case. Written shortly after the Cold War started in earnest in 1947, the plan de renseignement shows a French government deeply worried about the danger of global conflict and of internal upheaval in its empire, but also a government not fully committed to the western cause and particularly sceptical about American intentions. French foreign policy was at a crossroads in 1947/48 and, quite sensibly, French policy-makers wanted to know exactly what lay on all the possible roads ahead.

It focuses on the relationship between the intelligence on German intentions and capabilities and the evolution of French national policy from the rise of Hitler in 1933 to the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Based on extensive archival research, it considers the nature of the intelligence process and the place of intelligence within the French policy-making establishment during the inter-war period. The central argument in the book is that the German threat was far from the only challenge facing French national leaders in an era of economic depression and profound ideological discord. Only after the national humiliation at the Munich Conference did the threat from Nazi Germany take precedence over France's internal problems in the making of policy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VCR9X99N,2000-10-26,Peter Jackson,Oxford University Press,,2024-01-07T19:17:04Z,"['MP7FJ9UA', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

At this time, intelligence practices were transformed by the appearance of several intelligence bureaucracies. Studying three dimensions of the development – informal practices, formal organizations and statutory rules – the article demonstrates the closeness of intelligence to politics.

From the investigations of the 9/11 commission, to accusations of illegal wiretapping, to debates on whether it's acceptable to torture prisoners for information, intelligence—both accurate and not—is driving domestic and foreign policy. And yet, in part because of its inherently secretive nature, intelligence has received very little scholarly study. Into this void comes Reforming Intelligence , a timely collection of case studies written by intelligence experts, and sponsored by the Center for Civil-Military Relations (CCMR) at the Naval Postgraduate School, that collectively outline the best practices for intelligence services in the United States and other democratic states. Reforming Intelligence suggests that intelligence is best conceptualized as a subfield of civil-military relations, and is best compared through institutions. The authors examine intelligence practices in the United States, United Kingdom, and France, as well as such developing democracies as Brazil, Taiwan, Argentina, and Russia. While there is much more data related to established democracies, there are lessons to be learned from states that have created (or re-created) intelligence institutions in the contemporary political climate. In the end, reading about the successes of Brazil and Taiwan, the failures of Argentina and Russia, and the ongoing reforms in the United States yields a handful of hard truths.

 of Adolf Hitler and the 
Nazi party in Germany in January of 1933. It argues that French 
intelligence warned civilian and 
military leaders that the priorities of the new regime were rearmament
 and the militarization of 
German society in preparation for a war of conquest. This 
essentially accurate appreciation of the 
situation inside Germany had little impact on the course of 
French foreign policy. At this juncture 
French society was preoccupied with worsening economic crisis 
and pacifist sentiment had reached its 
inter-war zenith. The national focus was inward and domestic 
concerns took priority over the external 
threat from Germany. Finally, France was in a position of relative 
isolation and could garner no 
support for a policy of firmness from its erstwhile allies, Great 
Britain and the United States. This 
combination of national introspection and diplomatic isolation 
deterred a succession of governments 
from taking determined steps to meet the Nazi challenge in 1933.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/U4QXF2DL,1998-09-01,Peter Jackson,,The Historical Journal,2024-01-07T19:05:14Z,"['MP7FJ9UA', 'SCCGXHMZ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

importance of the military history in the Italian military intelligence. Although the entire military
community agrees that military history is a fundamental component for analyzing the environment and
better addressing future challenges, too often in Western military organizations this hardly finds a place
in military intelligence. In particular, in Italy, the study of war events starting from 1925 (the date of
establishment of Joint Italian military intelligence) has seen less and less space until it became marginal.
To understand the reason for this decline, it is necessary to analyze the historical, political, and cultural
roots of this choice made by the ruling class between 1925 and today. The thesis will demostrate that
studying history and contextualizing past events in the present is essential to face future challenges
better. Therefore, to fully understand the operating environment, it would be appropriate to restore the
importance of military history within the intelligence branch and in all military contexts at all levels. It
would be appropriate to give more space in the training program of the intelligence operators,

Once that direction is determined, one is able to survey the roads not taken, sorting out the possible and the probable from the unavoidable. This paper forswears the vocabulary of turning points, but it owes something to the idea such language expresses. Put cryptically, our discussions of the origins of the Second World War could afford to pay closer attention to Franco-Italian relations in the 1930s. Next to the Manchurian, Rhenish, Spanish, Austrian, Czech and Polish crises of that decade, the crisis within the ephemeral alliance between Paris and Rome has been given short shrift. Even within the context of the Ethiopian crisis there is a tendency to measure the implications against Anglo-French, Anglo-Italian and Italo-German relations. The net effect is to downplay the importance of relations between France and Italy.

The steady power shift from Bonn to Berlin coincided with a growing awareness and then later more confidence that Germany needed to engage more actively in European and global security politics. The activity of the intelligence services in the last decade of the twentieth century was mainly shaped by two factors: the resurgent (re-)emerging threat of international terrorism and advances in digitalisation.

It demonstrates how intelligence has changed in response to the threat, and how oversight mechanisms have reacted to that relationship. Intelligence and oversight in the United States have suffered from two problematic constraints, structure and ideology. Structural provisions governing the oversight of intelligence are relatively recent creations in the US system of government. Covert action was pivotal to the development of intelligence oversight.

The fundamental reform of the French intelligence community demonstrates fairly clearly the way that France currently recognises the international and security issues at stake and the very important role it attaches to the fight against terrorism. The strengthening of Homeland intelligence under the impact of counter-terrorism is completely understandable since terrorism is both a strategic threat and a particular form of crime. The strong involvement of all the services in counter-terrorism, the large-scale use of technical collection methods and the new legal framework have had a significant impact. The pre-eminence given to the fight against terrorism and to homeland intelligence has the potential to divert the French intelligence services from certain other important missions in a highly volatile international context.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/2IIHZT97,2018-08-24,Bertrand Warusfel,Routledge,,2024-01-07T18:24:03Z,"['DVEM4H4W', 'TLFN4NAL', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

The period from the end of the Cold War to the present day has been one of dramatic transformation for intelligence oversight in the UK, during which the agencies have emerged from the shadows of secrecy and democratic oversight has become well-established. The introduction of a statutory oversight framework for the agencies in the UK took place during what was in retrospect a short golden interval between the ending of the Cold War and the attacks of 9/11. The Snowden revelations have had a significant impact in the UK, since a number of them concern the work of Government Communications Headquarters and its collaboration with the National Security Agency in bulk collection of communication data.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/KBE28RCX,2018-08-24,Ian Leigh,Routledge,,2024-01-07T18:23:11Z,['DVEM4H4W']

The starting point in the reform of the Romanian intelligence system was a communist totalitarian society unspoiled by any attempt at political or economic liberalization. Several steps were taken in the early 1990s to establish a clear framework for objective civilian control of intelligence, with parliament, the government and the president sharing the legitimacy and responsibility for intelligence oversight. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and the subsequent 'war against terrorism' have marked the beginning of a second wave in Romanian intelligence reforms. Romania's support for North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and US-led coalitions deployed to fight terrorism has fostered military intelligence reform.

It also describes the work and propriety of the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS), a service that for years traditionally has focused on signal intelligence in the High North. The chapter discusses the impact on effective oversight. The 'Snowden disclosures' have nevertheless enhanced the NIS' broader awareness of societal legitimacy, and thereby underscored the Committee's reliance on informal trust and confidence as a means to instil a stronger sense of accountability. Since the end of the Cold War, therefore, the NIS has undergone a fundamental transformation. The EOS Committee experienced the 'Snowden disclosures' in much the same way as the NIS: as a 'fundamental watershed' in the history of intelligence, surveillance and oversight. Finally, with reference to the 2013 'Snowden disclosures', the broader societal implications on the relationship between the NIS and the EOS Committee are explored.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ND2MKLPT,2018-08-24,Tormod Heier,Routledge,,2024-01-07T18:21:28Z,"['DVEM4H4W', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

The chapter demonstrates how the body of intelligence oversight literature has been expanded both in thematic scope and focus. It illustrates that good principles and elaborated standards have often fallen short of actually being adopted in practice. The establishment of legitimate and effective intelligence oversight mechanisms is a demanding task for any democracy. Secrecy is a necessary prerequisite for many aspects of intelligence governance, including oversight. The most obvious tool to improve oversight bodies' ability to conduct their job is to give them full access to the intelligence services' digital and analogue systems, records, installations and other properties.

Since the turn of the millennium, intelligence agencies have been operating in a tense and rapidly changing security environment. This book addresses the impact of three factors on intelligence oversight: the growth of more complex terror threats, such as those caused by the rise of Islamic State; the colder East-West climate following Russia’s intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea; and new challenges relating to the large-scale intelligence collection and intrusive surveillance practices revealed by Edward Snowden. This volume evaluates the impact these factors have had on security and intelligence services in a range of countries, together with the challenges that they present for intelligence oversight bodies to adapt in response. With chapters surveying developments in Norway, Romania, the UK, Belgium, France, the USA, Canada and Germany, the coverage is varied, wide and up-to-date.

The importance of 'big data' in relation to intelligence became apparent years ago after the Echelon programme was revealed and after the Snowden revelations. The Committee is a permanent, independent body currently composed of 12 staff members, initially only responsible for reviewing the activities and functioning of the two Belgian intelligence services. Both before and after the 9/11 attacks, the Belgian intelligence services made different proposals to obtain more powers and more resources. The Belgian intelligence agencies only have had the legal power since 2010 to use intrusive intelligence methods: tapping, acquisition of telecommunications metadata, observations in houses or other private places, opening of post mail, hacking of IT-systems, requesting financial data.

It shows a remarkable amount of parallel evolutions and events that shaped the securitization of the Netherlands and Belgium. Both countries faced many common security and defence challenges, which they dealt with in their own way but still at times very similar. Such comparison offers insight into how the proximity and similar development of the Low Countries provided a relatively common set of security contingencies and activities, and the differing or similar attitudes and responses both countries adopted towards common security problems. The internationally precarious situation of the two small countries caught in the middle between France and Germany exposed them to a similar threat. Their strategic location in Europe was also responsible for similar challenges in the domestic security environment, such as the threat of socialist agitation and later terrorism.

It will be shown how mounting pressure from the rapidly expanding threat exacerbated the gradual exhaustion of the security services by structural issues of unaddressed organisational difficulties, and budget restrictions faced with increasing workloads. Due to the high number of foreign fighters, belated initiatives taken to assess the threat were impeded by barriers to information exchange, unclear guidance, and data overload. The failure of Belgian intelligence to detect the attack plans was more a symptom of policy failure than the underachievement of the services.

1727,Dutch intelligence - towards a qualitative framework for analysis: with case tudies on the Shipping Research Bureau and the National Security Service (BVD),Thesis,,"Wat is de kwaliteit van inlichtingen- en veiligheidsrapporten waarmee politici, bedrijven en non-gouvernementele organisaties werken? Deze vraag is in hoge mate onbeantwoord. Voor een belangrijk deel wordt dat veroorzaakt omdat inlichtingenstudies een nieuwe discipline is. 
De aanslagen op de Twin Towers en het Pentagon op 11 september 2001, de Amerikaanse en Britse rapporten over vermeende massavernietigingswapens in Irak, en de politiek en religieus geïnspireerde moorden in Nederland hebben geleid tot hernieuwde aandacht voor het inlichtingenwerk. Het inlichtingenwerk zal een meer centrale plaats innemen in de discussie over veiligheidszaken. Tegelijkertijd is het taxeren van de kwaliteit van inlichtingen- en veiligheids-rapporten grotendeels een blinde vlek.
Voor professionalisering – en daarmee verhoging – van de kwaliteit van rapporten is er een grote behoefte aan de mogelijkheid de kwaliteit ervan te kunnen taxeren. De gedachte is om een ex ante instrument te ontwikkelen om de kwaliteit te kunnen schatten van inlichtingen- en veiligheidsrapporten. Het verdient de voorkeur een test te ontwikkelen waarbij men de kwaliteit kan taxeren zonder dat men hoeft af te wachten of het bewuste rapport juist bleek te zijn. Dit is effectiever en wenselijker dan de huidige praktijk van zogeheten post mortem analyses, waarin achteraf terug wordt gekeken naar het rapport in kwestie. Rapporten worden bij een post mortem analyse meestal slechts bekeken vanuit de optiek of een waarschuwing had moeten worden gegeven. Zo een analyse leidt veelal tot vertekeningen omdat je de uitkomst al weet. Tevens blijft daarbij ook de onderliggende vraag onbeantwoord aan welke criteria kwalitatief hoogwaardige inlichtingen dienen te voldoen. Het ontwikkelen van een ex ante instrument kan in deze leemte voorzien.
Voor het toepassen van een ex ante instrument is het van belang zorg te dragen dat de evaluaties die zijn gebaseerd op dit ex ante instrument ook daad-werkelijk zinvol zijn. Daarvoor worden twee soorten literatuur onderzocht – literatuur over methodologie en literatuur van praktijkmensen vanuit het inlich-tingenwerk.
Tot slot dient er aandacht te worden besteed aan factoren die bijdragen tot een hoge of lage kwaliteit van een rapport.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VRPG6LUW,2005,Guillaume Gustav de Valk,,,2024-01-07T14:08:06Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

Despite the conventional academic and media wisdom on the Turkish “threat” (απειλή) during the 1987 crisis and successful Greek “deterrence” (αποτροπή), the author, citing key military intelligence and diplomatic officials, proves that Hellenic military intelligence assessed as low the Turkish operational military threat to the Greek armed forces in the Aegean. Surprisingly, while the Hellenic Navy mobilized the majority of the fleet, Ankara did not feel threatened by the possibility of a Greek military offensive. In response, the Turkish side used only aggressive rhetoric, but the Ankara generals decided against actual conflict with Athens. The author argues that since in 1987 there was no potential of a Greek-Turkish confrontation in the Aegean and no Turkish operational threat, the Greek show of force did not amount to deterrence. In order to deter a military threat there has to be aggressive military presence in time and place, not just boastful nationalistic rhetoric by the opponent.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HEKIR2G7,2007-05-01,Panagiotis Dimitrakis,,Journal of Modern Greek Studies,2024-01-07T13:47:46Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

While good intelligence cannot guarantee good policy, poor intelligence frequently contributes to policy failure. Then, what are the essentials of good intelligence? How should intelligence agencies be organized? What can bring about reliable intelligence? To answer these questions two countries that are widely acknowledged to incorporate intelligence successfully into foreign policy making and implementation, namely the UK and the US, are examined in terms of the stmcture of their intelligence systems in support of foreign policy. Therefore answers to the questions of how their systems are organized, overseen and coordinated are sought in this study. Then a comparison between the UK and the USA, which are accepted to ha’>'e the highest standard in this respect, and the Turkish system is made in order to show differences between the systems.

Despite the discoveries of recent research, there is still much more to be revealed about the handling of nuclear weapons before and during the Cuban Missile Crisis (CMC). Featuring contributions from a number of eminent international scholars of nuclear history, intelligence, espionage, political science and Cold War studies, An International History of the Cuban Missile Crisis reviews and reflects on one of the critical moments of the Cold War, focussing on three key areas.
First, the volume highlights the importance of memory as an essential foundation of historical understanding and demonstrates how events that rely only on historical records can provide misleading accounts. This focus on memory extends the scope of the existing literature by exploring hitherto neglected aspects of the CMC, including an analysis of the operational aspects of Bomber Command activity, explored through recollections of the aircrews that challenge accounts based on official records. The editors then go on to explore aspects of intelligence whose achievements and failings have increasingly been recognised to be of central importance to the origins, dynamics and outcomes of the missile crisis. Studies of hitherto neglected organisations such as the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the British Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) both extend our understanding of British and American intelligence machinery in this period and enrich our understanding of key episodes and assessments in the missile crisis.　Finally, the book explores the risk of nuclear war and looks at how close we came to nuclear conflict.　 The risk of inadvertent use of nuclear weapons is evaluated and a new proposed framework for the analysis of nuclear risk put forward.

Edward Snowden’s mass leaks were not the first transparency-driven digital challenge to the United States Intelligence Community (USIC). Three years before, then U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning provided 500,000 classified documents to WikiLeaks, which published them to great fanfare for transparency advocates while causing much concern in Washington. These are not isolated cases; the tempo of such mass public disclosures seems to be increasing. In what ways is this new breed of insider threat akin to more traditional counterintelligence breaches such as those of the Cold War? One central point of comparison is the relative damage caused by each, since it would be difficult to sustain the thesis that a new type of insidious threat has emerged if the damage caused by mass leaks was of little consequence when compared to traditional espionage cases. And ‘damage’ must be evaluated within the social history of the breaches themselves. A systematic approach to the comparison of breaches has remained elusive. This article offers such a framework using the Snowden leak as a case study in contemporary self-tasked digital breaches and the Cambridge Five spy ring as a case study in traditional externally-tasked breaches.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ABTS5XAU,2021-09-03,"David V.

Using recently declassified and underutilized files, the article explores the roles of the Official Committee on Communism (Home) and, more particularly, the Foreign Office Information Research Department. The Attlee and Churchill administrations of the late 1940s and early 1950s increasingly perceived the primary non-military threat of communism to Britain as part of Soviet-inspired transnational subversion of western European societies. This created a growing impetus for a symmetrical, transnational response through both domestic and foreign clandestine ‘indoctrination’ campaigns operating via influential non-state British institutions. Despite constitutional concerns still relevant today, in 1951 ministers endorsed the domestic component of this response as a fully-fledged strategy that would encourage greater state intervention in British society in the Cold War struggle for both liberty and security.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3GKKV5MR,2015-09-03,Thomas J.

On 9th August 1971 internment without trial was introduced in Northern Ireland. This was the British and Northern Ireland Government's response to the continuation of 'the troubles'. As troublemakers were not being convicted, interning them provided an alternative way of keeping them off the streets and it was hoped would increase the conviction rate, improving stability in the region. The British Army had been sent to Northern Ireland in August 1969 to help the local police force the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) restore order.

Despite the current public interest and its military importance, interrogation and questioning in conflict is still a largely under-researched theme. This volume’s methodological thrust is to select historical case studies ranging in time from the Great War to the conflicts in former Yugoslavia, and including the Second World War, decolonization, the Cold War, the ‘Troubles’ in Northern Ireland and international justice cases in The Hague, each of which raises interdisciplinary issues about the role of interrogation. These case-studies were selected because they resurface previously unexplored sources on the topic, or revisit known cases which allow us to analyse the role of interrogation and questioning in intelligence, security and military operations. 
Written by a group of experts from a range of disciplines including history, intelligence, psychology, law and human rights, Interrogation in War and Conflict provides a study of the main turning points in interrogation and questioning in twentieth-century conflicts, over a wide geographical area. The collection also looks at issues such as the extent of the use of harsh techniques, the value of interrogation to military intelligence, security and international justice, the development of interrogation as a separate profession in intelligence, as well as the relationship between interrogation and questioning and wider society.

As the British colonial office affirmed in a report to the Cabinet in late 1951, psychological warfare in Malaya was an 'Auxiliary Intelligence Instrument'. This windfall to the intelligence and psychological warfare system was furthered between 1950 and 1953 by organisational reform and civil-military integration at all levels which improved inter-service liaison and planning, and increased staffing and resources.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XX337HM7,2014-05-07,Thomas J.

Furthermore, it represents one of the most enigmatic aspects of the Cold War. This article challenges the notion that the Soviet Bloc provided uniform active support to late Cold War terrorists and suggests new categories of host. To demonstrate the complexities and paradoxes of state-terrorist relations we examine Communist Czechoslovakia's relations with Carlos the Jackal – the most notorious terrorist of the period. The historical consensus remains that Carlos was supported by the Eastern Bloc. However, as newly-released Eastern European secret service documents show, attitudes of Moscow's allies varied considerably. Czechoslovakia was, at best, a temporary and ‘anxious host’. The arrival of major terrorists in such ‘anxious’ states were in fact often unannounced, uninvited and undesired – yet the hosts fell short of arresting the terrorists either due to ideological affinity or fear of retribution. From his first visit to Prague, Carlos the Jackal was considered to be a threat and a reputational hazard by the Czechoslovak State Security (StB). Gradually, the StB adopted subtle measures aimed at deterring the return of Carlos and his Group. Finally, in the mid-1980s, they artfully ejected the Jackal and his accomplices from its territory, but without risking formal expulsion.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IVK24X45,2018-01-01,Daniela Richterova,,The International History Review,2024-01-05T09:00:19Z,"['TLFN4NAL', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Promising both greater transparency and lawful intelligence, these frameworks were then energetically rolled out to Central and Eastern Europe. Although officials boasted about their effectiveness, these formal accountability mechanisms have failed to identify serious abuses over the last decade. Moreover, the security regime in much of Central Europe still remains largely unreconstructed. The article argues that a robust culture of accountability cannot be conjured into existence merely by introducing new laws and regulations, or indeed by the increasing tide of media revelations about intelligence. However, it suggests that we are now seeing the rise of a more complex pattern of ‘ambient accountability’ which is at last challenging the secret state across Europe.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/UTDZIPWT,2018-07-04,"Richard J.

Utilising thousands of recently declassified archival materials from communist Czechoslovakia, this article aims to revise our understanding of everyday security practices and surveillance under communist regimes, which have thus far been overwhelmingly understood in relation to the domestic population and social control. In the 1970s and 1980s, Czechoslovakia attracted the Cold War terrorist and revolutionary elite. Visits by the likes of Carlos the Jackal, Munich Olympic massacre mastermind Abu Daoud, and key PLO figures in Prague were closely surveilled by the Czechoslovak State Security (StB). This article investigates the motifs and performance of a wide range of mechanisms that the StB utilised to surveil violent non-state actors, including informer networks and SIGINT. It argues that in the last decade of the Cold War, Prague adopted a “surveillance-centred” approach to international terrorists on its territory—arguably enabled by informal “non-aggression pacts.” Furthermore, it challenges the notion that the communist state security structures were omnipotent surveillance mechanisms. Despite having spent decades perfecting their grip on domestic dissent, when confronted with foreign, unfamiliar, and uncontrollable non-state actors engaged in terrorism or political violence, these ominous institutions were often shown to be anxious, inept, and at times impotent. Finally, it explores the parallel state approaches to international terrorists and revolutionaries, and their shortcomings, across the Iron Curtain jurisdictions.

But it, and other typologies, have placed too little emphasis on the influence of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on the evolution of global jihadist activities. This article makes two new contributions by developing both a new ICT-based typology for understanding jihadist evolutions, and by focusing on successful attacks. Our central argument is that ICTs’ impact on global jihadism has facilitated dramatic transformations of its strategy, organization and tactics since the 1990s, and that these can be understood as four overlapping iterations. ‘Jihadism 1.0’ describes the hierarchical, top-down directed and overseas financed and trained terrorist organizations that conducted iconic attacks at the turn of the millennium. Jihadism has since evolved into ‘Jihadism 2.0’ and then ‘Jihadism 3.0’. Jihadism 2.0 recognizes that a number of smaller, coordinated attacks can have a global impact. Jihadism 3.0 is inspired terrorism that has no links to the central terror organization, utilizing individuals and crude tactics. Finally, jihadism is evolving toward ‘Jihadism 4.0’, or cyberterrorism.

Driven by the desire to obtain political influence and hard currency, the program involved the delivery of arms, military technology, and training to select clients. However, Czechoslovakia faced many challenges, as the country struggled to offer quality training to Third World partners and to control foreign soldiers who often challenged military discipline and social order. Moreover, Prague also struggled to make the program commercially viable, as arms sales and student numbers dropped in the early 1960s. This paper reconstructs the inception, structure, operational challenges, and debates surrounding the key objectives of the Czechoslovak military training program for the Third World in the 1950s and 1960s. In particular, it focuses on the ‘tug of war’ waged by key stakeholders running the assistance program, which set political and geopolitical interests against commercial gain. By interrogating the challenges of Czechoslovakia’s military assistance programs to the Third World, this paper provides a rare insight into Prague’s foreign policy at a crucial juncture, when it fashioned a new, activist role in the Third World. It challenges the assumption that this highly sensitive area of Czechoslovak foreign policy was defined either by politics or by commercial interests, rather arguing that it was shaped by a constant struggle between these two often competing priorities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/INRVLMDJ,2021-01-02,"Daniela Richterova, Mikuláš Pešta, Natalia Telepneva",,The International History Review,2024-01-05T08:53:09Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

My research also considers the ways in which African Americans personally contributed to meet the Union’s intelligence needs, often at great personal risk. My research for the first time reveals that African Americans also provided intelligence supporting the South, a role mainly occurring in the war’s early years, and which diminished greatly once the Union declared the demise of slavery as a strategic goal.

leave Kent’s positivist legacy behind. Constructivism offers much more profitable
prospects, especially for intelligence studies, whose academic status is endangered by
clinging to an outdated positivism. Meanwhile intelligence, which has often used Kent’s
ideas as an ideology to fend off intelligence consumers, should do better to no longer
pretend to come close to a science. Instead, using Aristoteles division in episteme
(science), techne (tradecraft) and phronesis (practical wisdom), intelligence analysis
should be seen as practical wisdom (phronesis) for practical decision-making. This
would allow intelligence to embrace cognitive diversity in order to proffer different kinds
of policy support. Leaning toward constructivism would help intelligence to become
more action-oriented instead of information-oriented under the doom of positivism.

definition include covert action or secrecy as being an important part of the activity? Is
it relevant intelligence to be defined as the knowledge and foreknowledge necessary to

intelligence, implicitly or explicitly, involves adopting and assuming IR theoretical
prepositions and intends to explore the implications of IR constructivist assumptions in
defining intelligence. In our opinion, the task of defining intelligence is provocative
because it is very difficult to reach an objective definition delineated from subjective
views imbued in the author`s creeds of the preferable world system. For instance,
defining intelligence in terms of agency through which states seek to protect or extend
their relative advantage places the author in a political culture of organizing the world
in realist perspective, with predefined actors, and reveals the dependence to particular
security culture.
IR constructivist approach generates alternative interpretations of world
politics therefore defining intelligence through constructivist lenses would lead to new

and manipulating the intelligence activities of opposing/external entities (groups,
organizations, states), and is usually explained as protection of secrets against espionage
(counterintelligence). In particular, in some states, in addition to the classic intelligence
activities, clandestine/covert operations (in Western terminology) or active measures (in
Soviet/Russian terminology) are conducted. By means of such operations the decisions
or events, the political, military or social circumstances in another state are influenced in
order to promote own foreign policy objectives. Such operations are conducted by
intelligence structures, as they have available specialized personnel and specific skills,
necessary for the complex integration of various resources and techniques to exercise
influence. Taking this aspect into account, it should come as no surprise that the
approaches used in order to identify and neutralize such operations get materialized in
the area of counterintelligence. The paper is aimed at exploring some active measures
which could be used to reconfigure counterintelligence, becoming then relevant for an
effective national security policy. A comparative analysis between the two former Cold
War superpowers – the USSR and the US – is performed in order to exemplify and
support the arguments presented while also underlining the peculiarity of Soviet
(present day Russian) conducts. In the first instance, the historical perspective/lens is

openness and access to information have fallen into a new era of interest for numerous
actors playing in the societal democratic arena – citizens, organizations, the private
sector, governments, media, politicians, international partners and so on. A paradox of
transparency should be its presence in the intelligence field – born and raised on a
strong basis of secrecy and conspiracy. While questioning what intelligence
transparency is or, how we like to call it – “intelligence in plain sight”, we discovered the
inexistence of a public, academic or institutional framework defining the topic.
Therefore, this article aims at taking the first steps into this direction, by
defining a couple of constants and variables, essential parties and indicators which
should be comprised into a strategic joint venture, setting out to develop a framework
for the practice of intelligence transparency. Also, this article underlines the need for
liaison between these factors, meant to balance between the two oxymoronic adjectives –
secretive and transparent. The analysis starts with a picture of how transparency looks
like for governments – whether they are open or not, and it goes on with a legal
perspective, only to end by catching the few elements surrounding the intelligence

analyse the process of cooperation from a dual perspective, in order to identify the

process and, in the end, to offer suggestions for cooperation improvement.
Communication in this area is essential not only for the two actors and the organizations

The paper begins by distinguishing between information and intelligence, with
the relationship between intelligence officials and decision-makers through the briefing
process, in order to highlight the necessity and importance of cooperation and to
establish at the same time a theoretical basis. It continues with the advantages and
disadvantages of briefing and of direct cooperation instead of sending the message
without messenger, with the factors that prove to influence cooperation in practice. Last
but not least, the article puts forward a series of suggestions for the improvement of
cooperation.
Ultimately, intelligence efficiency depends on both the decision and decisionmakers. Direct and indirect cooperation is influenced in practice by objective and
subjective factors, by the harmonization of the two different groups, by the availability of
decision makers, by an intelligence and political culture, by a cooperation based on

specific platform of intelligence work, its historical development, and transfer from the

counterintelligence and epidemiological contact tracing. The aim of this paper is to
anticipate the consequences of the Covid-19 crisis on the future of the global security
environment, and to point out new perspectives. It is undeniable that the Covid-19 crisis
has imposed the need for medical intelligence to adapt to the new security reality. This
process implies not only further development of specific resources (in accordance with
MEDINT criteria), but also external connection with professional and academic
communities, as well as continuous monitoring of activities that carry a certain risk to

system of the French Republic, evaluating its degree of compliance in relation with a set

made using the CODV tool of Six-Sigma.
The study validates to what extent France’s national security strategy sets out
directions to strengthen economic security. At the same time, the article analyses if the
architecture of the national economic intelligence system facilitates efforts correlation
within the intelligence community and whether the cooperation between the national
economic intelligence system’s entities categories can be realised. Subsequently, it is
analysed whether the economic intelligence system is an integrated component of the
national intelligence system, whether it allows all sources analysis and whether it
facilitates the use of new technologies through intelligence cycle stages. Following the
above steps, it is finally determined with what efficiency the France’s economic intelligence
system can provide support information needed to increase the competitiveness of the
national economy. Thus, analysing areas in which the French economic intelligence system
performs, were identified some good practices that can be the basis for proposals to

After the defeat of France, German soldiers found on June 19, 1940, by chance, in abandoned railroad cars in La Charité-sur-Loire, many French secret documents which Berlin saw as a confirmation of this claim. The German Foreign Ministry in 1941 published 70 of these documents in Denmark and in other occupied countries including France. These texts were used in press articles and in some official speeches. This paper describes the circumstances of the capture and argues that the documents are genuine and may, with caution, be used as historical evidence, although the 1941 publication was indeed propaganda. A small number of the documents are presented in some detail. The German publication has apparently not been used by Danish historians, but a few post-war historians in Great Britain, the USA, France and Germany have made use of the “captured French documents” and have discussed their historical value.

evolution in the information era. Volumes of open-source information have never been so
broad and high, and today’s technology is able to monitor interesting topics, contrast and
match new data with old, spot early signs and discover previously unknowns, patterns and
relationships at a level never seen before. This has not gone unnoticed by Law enforcement
authorities (LEAs) and intelligence services (SISs), which, slowly but steadily, have
embraced this new environment. OSINT is today exploited by LEAs and SISs for all types of
intelligence needs, starting from (near) situational awareness, to investigatory and
preventive purposes.
The rapid evolution has, nevertheless, created new, and exacerbated existing
operational challenges. Assessing reliability against online data manipulation and
disinformation has become a great challenge in the Internet era. While advanced
technology is needed to extract and analyse the sheer volumes of data, measuring the
outcome of these tools is not easy due to difficulties in traceability, pre-existing human
and algorithmic bias, the institutions’ need for secrecy and the existing opacity around the
vendors and their products. All those challenges can result in inaccurate OSINT products
being later used for decision-making. Those, when used by SISs and LEAs, can affect by
extension human rights such as the right to freedom from discrimination and the right to
a fair trial.
This article analyses those operational challenges and their subsequent impacts
on human rights. It does so by doing a comprehensive literature review on the topic
through academic articles, national and international institutional reports, and
newspaper articles. The study focuses on concrete problematic activities involving the
creation and use of current OSINT products and describes examples that are not limited
to one jurisdiction. Structuring both the OSINT operational challenges and their subsequent impacts on human rights is the novelty of this article. While some academics
have addressed several of those challenges affecting advanced mining technologies
overall, addressing the operational challenges and their impacts from a single focal point –
OSINT, is novel. Addressing them in a structured manner is a necessary first step to carve

In the Balkans, the war overlapped with political and ethnic conflicts, engulfing the region in bloody civil wars. In Central and Eastern Europe, partisan movements engaged the Germans without losing sight of the danger posed by the arrival of the Red Army. In France and in Italy, the adoption of the slogans of national liberation provided the communist parties with a formidable democratic legitimacy, which established them as key players in the political lives of their countries.

The British and the Americans worked to stir up, support, control, and direct these resistance groups. London created the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and Washington the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), both of whom sent agents into occupied Europe to liaise directly with the guerilla groups. Through the Comintern, Moscow carefully coordinated the actions of the European communist parties with the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, which was acting for the first time as a key player in the arena of international relations.

The forests and the mountains where the partisans were fighting the Germans soon became a major part of the proxy war that the Big Three waged to shift the post-war geopolitical balance in their favour. Looking for the first time at the Big Three in a comparative study and spanning Europe from Yugoslavia to Poland, from Greece to France and Italy, this book vividly depicts and sharply analyses how this proxy war shaped the history of the post-war settlement.

Law enforcement agencies were listening to private telephone calls as early as 1895. Communications firms have assisted government eavesdropping programs since the early twentieth century—and they have spied on their own customers too. Such breaches of privacy once provoked outrage, but today most Americans have resigned themselves to constant electronic monitoring. How did we get from there to here?In The Listeners, Brian Hochman shows how the wiretap evolved from a specialized intelligence-gathering tool to a mundane fact of life. He explores the origins of wiretapping in military campaigns and criminal confidence games and tracks the use of telephone taps in the US government’s wars on alcohol, communism, terrorism, and crime. While high-profile eavesdropping scandals fueled public debates about national security, crime control, and the rights and liberties of individuals, wiretapping became a routine surveillance tactic for private businesses and police agencies alike.From wayward lovers to foreign spies, from private detectives to public officials, and from the silver screen to the Supreme Court, The Listeners traces the long and surprising history of wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping in the United States.

The three major instruments that guide United States foreign policy are the Treaty Power, the War Power, and the Spy Power. Within the category of Spy Power is the ""Third Option"" the use of covert action. Ever since the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947, the US has often turned to the third option in the conduct of its international relations.

             Loch Johnson's new book explores the subject of covert action, often referred to as a ""Third Option"" between America's use of diplomacy and warfare---a shadowy approach to international affairs based on the controversial use of secret propaganda, political activities, economic sabotage, and paramilitary operations (whether clandestine warfare or assassinations). The three major instruments that guide United States foreign policy are the Treaty Power, the War Power, and the Spy Power. Within the category of Spy Power is the ""Third Option"" the use of covert action. Ever since the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947, the US has often turned to the third option in the conduct of its international relations. This controversial approach includes covert propaganda campaigns, subversive political activities, economic sabotage, and paramilitary operations ranging from clandestine warfare to the assassination of foreign leaders. From the beginning of the Cold War to the present day, America's intelligence and national security agencies have employed all of these ""third option"" tools in order to advance America's global interests.In The Third Option, the eminent national security scholar Loch Johnson provides a history of American covert warfare from 1947 to the present.

However, its members were detained by the rebels and ejected from the country. This article puts the literature on public policy failures into dialogue with that on covert action as a tool of foreign policy. It asks: why did this not develop into a fully fledged policy fiasco when journalists and politicians judged it to have been a major error of judgement on Hague’s part? Using narrative analysis of the contemporary reporting of this incident, we argue that the government – possessing the advantage of information asymmetry accruing from operational secrecy – was able to win the battle of narratives in a frame contestation process.

This appears puzzling: the UK was overstretched; Latin America fell outside its area of strategic interest; and UK covert action was dwarfed by that of the US. After revealing this activity for the first time, this article argues that the UK turned to covert action for reasons beyond orthodox explanations of reducing threats in a plausibly deniable manner.

Assessing the reforms recommended following a number of counterinsurgency difficulties, it discusses the role of the CO in the centralised intelligence assessment process. This article argues that relations between the CO and the JIC were underdeveloped and that reforms aimed to allow a greater coordination and a more active JIC input into colonial affairs. However, in doing so, the committee threatened to encroach into CO territory, bringing with it military conceptualisations of the Cold War and an allegedly narrow focus on communist subversion which marginalised more complex colonial problems. This resulted in the threat of a Whitehall ‘showdown’.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YCQAR3I4,2011-06-01,Rory Cormac,,The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History,2023-12-27T17:44:55Z,"['CZT6L9T7', 'CK5MNYPQ']"

It argues that the IRD’s role was driven by decisions taken at the very top of government and took shape against a context of financial cuts, a deteriorating security situation in Northern Ireland, and a tradition of domestic propaganda in the UK. The IRD sought to advance four key themes: exploiting divisions within the IRA; undermining the IRA’s credibility amongst the population; linking the IRA to international terrorism; and portraying the IRA as communist.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VA5NTWSD,2016-10-01,Rory Cormac,,The English Historical Review,2023-12-27T17:44:14Z,"['B6RJNLTK', 'V7KUA58M']"

This prioritization has been reflected in the recent requirements of the United Kingdom's intelligence and security actors. Yet, scholarly research has neglected the relationship between intelligence, international economics, and contemporary security policy. Taking current requirements as a catalyst, this article draws on contemporary British history to explore when intelligence can be used to protect economic security and when intelligence actors can best use economic measures to achieve broader politico-military goals.

It therefore sheds new light on London's security and intelligence machine and its input into clandestine operations. Drawing on recently declassified documents and interviews, it uncovers various important but secretive actors, which have been overlooked or misunderstood in the existing literature, and outlines their functions in the most detail yet available.

Using the over-emphasised threat of maritime terrorism in 1970 as a case study, this article is able to examine the intelligence cycle as a whole and consider the importance of source validation, the dangers of incremental analysis, and the need for coordinated advice disseminated coherently to consumers both inside and outside of the government.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/LCYJZJJ6,2013-07-01,Rory Cormac,,Terrorism and Political Violence,2023-12-27T17:41:45Z,['TLFN4NAL']

The ambiguity of the concept may have consequences for the way in which ILP is welcomed and used in police agencies throughout Europe. ILP allows police organizations to create interconnections, both internally between police processes and externally with other (security) actors. In contrast, it may be conceivable that in the ILP model the police (and not the citizens or their elected representatives) determine crime-fighting priorities, which contrasts strongly with the spirit of the community policing model. Within the United Kingdom, it was particularly the Kent County Constabulary that was influential in spreading the concept of ILP. This came after the use of intelligence-led policing in Northern Ireland, where the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had been involved in a long-term anti-terrorism campaign against the Irish Republican Army (IRA).",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5PDL3LE4,2014,Monica den Boer,Routledge,,2023-12-27T11:14:59Z,['HCN8YFI8']

The chapter addresses the reality of international and hybrid intelligence cooperation by looking at it as intelligence assemblages, a concept that has also been used to study public-private security cooperation at the national and international level, and surveillance practices. The nodal governance of security is consisting of a plurality of decision centres in which no clear hierarchy between centres exists. The reflections on the unpredictability of change and the essential non-functionalist character of assemblages offer a link to a final concept useful for analysing international intelligence and security cooperation: the logic of practicality.

In both civilian and military intelligence, analysts work from an enormous existing database. During the Cold War only the most sophisticated and advanced intelligence systems could intercept communications or other electronic signals, mostly using satellites for the purpose. The main failing is that intelligence cycle model leaves out two of the key functions of intelligence: counter-intelligence (CI) and covert action (CA).

The definition of intelligence purpose refers to decision-making and thus to actions people want to take and outcomes they want to see. The world of national security and intelligence takes a strongly rationalist Enlightenment stance based on the assumption of human improvement. At each link of the intelligence chain, well-known cognitive weaknesses appears to delay or distort connections that need to be made: intelligence studies literature is full of discussion of group think, mirror imaging, transferred judgements, confirmation bias and similar hiatuses. A traditional way of modelling intelligence knowledge is to make a distinction between estimates of capabilities and of intentions.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VB8IRDLU,2014,David Omand,Routledge,,2023-12-27T11:08:35Z,['HCN8YFI8']
1848,The Future of Intelligence: Challenges in the 21st century,Book,https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203071472,"This volume discusses the challenges the future holds for different aspects of the intelligence process and for organisations working in the field. 
The main focus of Western intelligence services is no longer on the intentions and capabilities of the Soviet Union and its allies. Instead, at present, there is a plethora of threats and problems that deserve attention. Some of these problems are short-term and potentially acute, such as terrorism. Others, such as the exhaustion of natural resources, are longer-term and by nature often more difficult to foresee in their implications.
This book analyses the different activities that make up the intelligence process, or the ‘intelligence cycle’, with a focus on changes brought about by external developments in the international arena, such as technology and security threats. Drawing together a range of key thinkers in the field, The Future of Intelligence examines possible scenarios for future developments, including estimations about their plausibility, and the possible consequences for the functioning of intelligence and security services.
This book will be of much interest to students of intelligence studies, strategic studies, foreign policy, security studies and IR in general.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HMBC2MLR,2014-03-24,"Isabelle Duyvesteyn, Ben de Jong, Joop Reijn",Routledge,,2023-12-27T11:07:30Z,['WHBCJ8GW']

Any “practical” or “pragmatic” enterprise, however, contains implicit assumptions about purpose, priorities, ethics, and even moral constraints. At the highest theoretical level, intelligence involves unavoidable assumptions and presumptions about heuristics, the nature of truth, the definition of risk, and the possibility of a “scientific” approach to predictive analysis. This paper proposes that there is no single, “philosophy of intelligence,” but that the application of philosophy is critical for understanding what intelligence is, why we pursue intelligence, what limits expectations from intelligence, and what the normative constraints on intelligence should be.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/69I78YE8,2022-09-19,Terry C.

The idea of “intelligence studies” provides the overarching context, but among those working within the field, understandings vary as to precisely what it is or should be. This is an opportune moment to reflect on our approaches to the study of intelligence, the assumptions underpinning them, and how the study has evolved since the 1950s. In doing this, we identify three key questions that need to be considered: What is “intelligence studies”?; should it be considered to be, or should it aspire to become, a “discipline”?; and who is it for?

Intelligence capabilities may have to be kept separate from decision-making because of organizational economies of scale and scope, but separation alone does not mean intelligence must be distant from decision-making. For example, the British style of analysis involves a much closer relationship between intelligence producers and consumers than exists in the American context. Efforts to improve the integration of intelligence into decision-making by closing the distance between them would do well to study the history and efficacy of this process as they look to create new ways of structuring the relationship between intelligence analysis and decision-making. Specifically, history demonstrates that the US National Security Council staff implemented a process in 1968 through 1980 that approximated the British style of analysis, and this may provide US policymakers with a model for bridging the gap between intelligence analysis and decision-making.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/53A3EABI,2009-10-01,"Stephen Marrin, Philip H.J.

Key questions discussed include the role of intelligence theory in organising the study of intelligence, how (and how far) explanations of intelligence have progressed in the last decade, and how intelligence theory should develop from here.

Significant changes have occurred in the security intelligence environment in recent years—including transformative information technologies, the advent of ‘new’ terrorism, and the emergence of hybrid warfare—making this an opportune moment to take stock and consider how we explain what intelligence does and how. The material made available via the 2013 Edward Snowden leaks and subsequent national debates has contributed much to our understanding of contemporary intelligence processes and has significant implications for future theorisation, for example, in relation to the concept of ‘surveillance’.

The contributors are leading figures in Intelligence Studies who represent a range of different approaches to conceptual thinking about intelligence.

                      share the paradoxical task of operating in secret in order to defend an open society. Recent intelligence scandals have illustrated that democracies are not immune from the politicization of intelligence services by members of the executive or from illegal practices by members of the intelligence services. One can point to the British and US governments’ selective usage of intelligence assessments in the months before the Iraq war in 2003. The infamous “dodgy dossier” springs to mind, a UK government publication that inserted plagiarized excerpts from an academic source in an attempt to make the case for an imminent threat to international peace and security posed by Baghdad. The British intelligence community, the UK government claimed on numerous occasions, had fully endorsed the estimation that “Iraqi military are able to deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so”.

Earlier he had disestablished the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the wartime foreign intelligence collection and analytical entity, declaring that he did not want an American Gestapo in peacetime. By 1947, he had changed his mind on the need for a civilian intelligence organization for three principal reasons. First, and most importantly, the lessons of the 1941 Pearl Harbor attack strongly suggested the need for greater early warning of a future surprise attack on the United States. Second, he needed a centralizing intelligence organization that would gather and analyze all the intelligence reports headed for the Oval Office and attempt to make something coherent out of them so he would not have to do it himself. It is not clear that he wanted the new organization to go out and collect intelligence information on its own, as this had been tasked primarily to the Armed Services and to the FBI.

From the summer of 1945 until March 1956 the US engaged, developed, and financed a German intelligence organization which was led by former Wehrmacht officers and intelligence professionals and which essentially provided Washington with information and studies on the Soviet Union and its satellites. The first detailed account was published by the key figure on the German side, Reinhard Gehlen, in his 1971 memoirs. Later publications elaborated somewhat on that story but failed to add much because archival sources were tightly closed on both the American and the German sides. No original documents from that period were available until 2002 when the CIA released a “documentary history” prepared by Kevin C. Ruffner of the CIA history staff. A year later, and obviously in tandem with those CIA releases, James H. Critchfield published his book Partners in the Creation. Critchfield had been an important figure on the US side of that peculiar intelligence relationship, acting as an on-site CIA supervisor of the Gehlen group.

Therefore what we have is an increasingly rich array of accounts of national intelligence systems including fascinating insights into processes of transition. Analyses of single agencies, companies, countries and even non-governmental organisations involved in intelligence will always provide the bedrock for intelligence studies but even where these accounts are collected together they may amount to no more than juxtaposition.

Few states take the view that they can dispense with an intelligence service and none is sufficiently immune from terrorism or the inquisitiveness of its neighbours to forgo a security service. It is true that a variety of patterns for organising security and intelligence exists. Some states (for example, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey) have a single agency for security and intelligence (both domestic and external). Others have distinct agencies for domestic and external intelligence and security, with either separate or overlapping territorial competences, as in the United Kingdom, Poland, Hungary and Germany. More rarely, a state may have a domestic security agency but no acknowledged or actual foreign intelligence agency; Canada is the exemplar of this approach. A further variable is that either intelligence or security services may have either a more pro-active mandate or be restricted to the gathering and analysis of information.

By its nature as an activity that could involve the loss of fragile sources or means of understanding and influence – not to mention the lives of troops, subjects, and even leaders – intelligence is treated by its practitioners as sensitive and confidential. Even the accidental disclosure of some analytical, informational, or operational advantage over a rival or an enemy is presumed to be tantamount to the loss of that advantage while it is still potentially useful. Thus the penalties for disclosure have always been severe – and those for espionage even harsher. Nations have sought thereby to terrify disloyalty and also to protect the advantages that secret means seem to bring to decisionmaking.

Intelligence has been in the news consistently since 9/11 and the Iraqi WMD errors. Leading experts in the field approach the three major missions of intelligence: collection-and-analysis; covert action; and counterintelligence. Within each of these missions, the dynamically written essays dissect the so-called intelligence cycle to reveal the challenges of gathering and assessing information from around the world. Covert action, the most controversial intelligence activity, is explored, with special attention on the issue of military organizations moving into what was once primarily a civilian responsibility. The authors furthermore examine the problems that are associated with counterintelligence, protecting secrets from foreign spies and terrorist organizations, as well as the question of intelligence accountability, and how a nation can protect its citizens against the possible abuse of power by its own secret agencies.

least until the end of the Cold War, circumstances since then have changed
significantly. During the 1990s a variety of inter-linked factors brought intelligence blinking out of the dark, if only into the twilight, for example, the perception that insecurities took a greater variety of forms such as organised crime and
trafficking, the interest in intelligence methods of a wider variety of state and
corporate agencies and the rapid growth of technologies facilitating the gathering, processing and storing of information. These factors were all massively

Improving intelligence analysis requires bridging the gap between scholarship and practice. Compared to the more established academic disciplines of political science and international relations, intelligence studies scholarship is generally quite relevant to practice. Yet a substantial gap exists nonetheless. Even though there are many intelligence analysts, very few of them are aware of the various writings on intelligence analysis which could help them improve their own processes and products. If the gap between scholarship and practice were to be bridged, practitioners would be able to access and exploit the literature in order to acquire new ways to think about, frame, conceptualize, and improve the analytic process and the resulting product. This volume contributes to the broader discussion regarding mechanisms and methods for improving intelligence analysis processes and products. It synthesizes these articles into a coherent whole, linking them together through common themes, and emphasizes the broader vision of intelligence analysis in the introduction and conclusion chapters.

The book will be of great interest to students of intelligence studies, strategic studies, US national security, US foreign policy, security studies and political science in general,as well as professional intelligence analysts and managers.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZLPQVPKS,2012-12-15,Stephen Marrin,Routledge,,2023-12-27T09:29:02Z,['CZJ36V8L']

These events brought to an end an enormous expansion of the KGB, the secret political police of the Soviet Union, which on the eve of the coup had under its command some 700,000 people in the Soviet Union including 12,000 intelligence officers. Something like between 1,500-2,000 of these officers were stationed abroad. At least 250 KGB officers were at work in Canada and the USA. This figure does not include the assets: the secret informers and KGB contacts in North America.

Right up to the abortive coup of August 1991, it supplied regular reports designed to show its success in influencing the politicians and public opinion of the Third World. The format seems to have changed little from Brezhnev to Gorbachev. Among documents released from Communist Party Central Committee archives during the year after the coup was a 1969 report from the then KGB chairman, Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov, boasting of the KGB's ability to organize large protest demonstrations outside the US embassy in Delhi for $5,000 a time, and a letter to Gorbachev 20 years later by Andropov's successor, Vladimir Aleksandrovich Kryuchkov, reporting an increased number of agents in the Sri Lankan parliament and the 'sincere gratitude to Moscow' allegedly expressed by the leader of the Freedom Party for Soviet 'financial support'.
                  1
                The KGB was also fond of boasting of its influence on a wide variety of international organisations, ranging from sections of the peace movement to the World Council of Churches (WCC). One recently declassified document of 1969 describes the work of five KGB agents on the WCC Central Committee and the appointment of another to a 'high WCC post'. A similar report of 1989 claims that, as the result of agent operations to implement 'a plan approved by the KGB leadership', 'the WCC Executive and Central Committee adopted public statements (eight) and messages (three) which corresponded to the political course of Socialist [Communist] countries'. While it would be naive to take such boasting entirely at its face value, there can be little doubt about the reality of Soviet penetration of the WCC.

                Gaddis, in effect, identified an intellectual community, in the Kuhnian sense, being created, flourishing, and going about its business in a coherent, consensual way. That may be so, but what is more remarkable and regrettable is the failure to integrate intelligence studies, even in a primitive way, into the mainstreams of research in international relations. That is less so with respect to international history. If one sees international history, therefore, as a central part of the field of enquiry that is international relations (for it is a field of enquiry and not a discipline), the depiction is flawed. But if one subscribes to the more orthodox view, so prevalent in the United States, that international history is peripheral to the study of international relations, dominated as it is by political scientists of various stripes, the depiction is accurate. Indeed, it provides one of the clues as to why there exist not competitive solitudes exactly, but two almost distinct, discrete communities, devoted, respectively, to the study of intelligence and the study of international relations.

In 1995, it marked the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the Inostrannyi Otdel (INO), the foreign intelligence arm of the Cheka and its inter-war successors, by publishing a volume which celebrated the careers of 75 leading intelligence officers and agents of the Soviet era in a style which differed little from the uncritical hagiographies previously produced by the KGB.
                  1
                In 1995, the SVR also began the publication of a multi-volume official history of Soviet foreign intelligence operations which, at the time of writing, has reached the end of the Great Patriotic War.

                Though a mine of mostly reliable factual information, it too presents a heroically sanitised view of Soviet intelligence history. The videos on foreign operations in the Stalin era recently produced by the SVR’s Television Information Service take a similar approach.

This book, first published in 1986, lifts the veil on some of these historical secrets. Christopher Andrew and Keith Neilson cast new light on how Tsarist codebreakers penetrated British code and cypher systems. John Chapman’s study of German military codebreaking represents a major advance in our understanding of cryptanalysis during the Weimar Republic. The history of the Government Code and Cypher School – forerunner of today’s GCHQ – by its operational head, the late A.G. Denniston, provides both a general assessment of the achievements of British cryptanalysis between the wars and a tantalising glimpse of what historians may one day find in GCHQ’s forbidden archives. The distinguished cryptanalyst of Bletchley Park, the late Gordon Welchman, describes in detail how the Ultra programme defeated the German Enigma machine, while another Bletchley Park cryptographer, Christopher Morris, reminds us in his account of the valuable work on hand cyphers that wartime sigint consisted of much more than Ultra. Roger Austin’s study of surveillance under the Vichy regime shows the continuing importance of older and simpler methods of message interception such as letter-opening.

generated and used. This chapter provides a different focus that treats secrecy,
rather than knowledge, as an organising theme. Instead of scrutinising the process
of gathering, analysing and exploiting intelligence, it examines other activities of
secret intelligence services, often termed covert action. This broader framework
draws upon both pre-modern ‘Secret Service’ activities that predated modern
intelligence organisations,2 as well as many Cold War studies. It resonates with
the perspective of Richard Aldrich that secret service activity includes ‘operations to
influence the world by unseen means – the hidden hand’.3 Exploration of secret
intervention illuminates important themes and issues in the study of intelligence,
and identifies challenges and opportunities for enquiry, particularly in the context
of the British experience. One further aspect is examined and developed – the
role of secret intelligence services in conducting clandestine diplomacy, a
neglected yet intriguing dimension that also provides insights into the study of
intelligence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZTVSVYUQ,2004,Len Scott,Routledge,,2023-12-26T23:07:20Z,['B6RJNLTK']

Nazi police operating behind the German troops invading the Soviet Union were
murdering thousands of Jews but that they and the British wartime Prime Minister
Winston Churchill, who read their messages, did nothing about it. These claims
were first published in 1998 in the book Official Secrets:What the Nazis
Planned,What the British and Americans Knew by Professor Richard Breitman.
He argued that instead of using the intelligence to show the world the plight of
the Jews the British ‘simply hoarded’ it. Churchill should have told the world,
warning the Jews in countries like Romania and Bulgaria, which were as yet
not under German occupation, of what was going on. Professor Breitman also
criticised the British for failing to provide the intelligence reports as evidence to
the International Tribunal at Nuremberg at which those Nazis accused of war
crimes were tried. His allegations were repeated in a number of newspaper articles
publicising the book, and often based on interviews with him, which carried
headlines such as: ‘Britain Accused of Hiding Facts on Holocaust’; ‘Should
Churchill have Acted?’; and ‘MI6 Concealed Extermination of Jews’.1",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YUI8GT3Y,2004,Michael Smith,Routledge,,2023-12-26T23:01:06Z,"['T92JK7A5', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

dramatically in the months preceding the Gregynog conference, which gave rise
to the studies in this volume. One of the distinguishing characteristics of the
Soviet intelligence system from Cheka to KGB was its militant atheism. In
March 2002, however, the FSB, the born-again post-Soviet successor to the
domestic arm of the KGB, at last found God. A restored Russian Orthodox
Church in central Moscow was consecrated by Patriarch Aleksi II as the FSB’s
parish church in order to minister to the previously neglected spiritual needs of its
staff. The FSB Director, Nikolai Patrushev, who was present at the consecration,
celebrated the mystical marriage of the Orthodox Church and the state security
apparatus by a solemn exchange of gifts, presenting the Patriarch with ceremonial
golden keys to the church and receiving in exchange two religious icons – the
possession of which would formerly have been a sufficiently grave offence to
cost any KGB officer his job. Those who visit the FSB Church when next in
Moscow may like to stop for lunch, dinner or a cocktail in the nearby Shield and
Sword Café, which takes its name from the traditional symbols of the KGB
(inherited from the Cheka), and appears to cater to a clientele drawn largely from
the nearby FSB headquarters. A bust of Yuri Andropov, the only KGB chief to
become Soviet leader, stands on a pedestal draped with blue velvet in the lobby,
while the restaurant itself is dominated by a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the
founder of the Cheka.2",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BGC8PD5U,2004,Christopher Andrew,Routledge,,2023-12-26T22:58:03Z,['HCN8YFI8']
1935,"A German Preference for a Medium-Range Battle? British Assumptions about German Naval Gunnery, 1914–1915",Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1177/0968344511422310,"In several recent studies of the Royal Navy a theory has emerged about the development of British battle-fleet tactics. It is suggested that, in the period leading up to the battle of Jutland, the Admiralty possessed intelligence which indicated that the German naval leadership, if it sought to fight at all, wanted to engage at medium range, where its superior secondary batteries and heavier torpedo armament could be used to maximum advantage. Rather than seeking to frustrate this desire by manoeuvring to keep the battle at long range, the British, it has been argued, decided to accommodate to the German preference, but only with a view to using their superior main armament to unleash a concentrated five-minute pulse of fire at the approaching German vessels, before turning away. This article looks at one of the underpinnings of this argument, namely British intelligence on German gunnery. It shows that from the start of the First World War, if not earlier, the Admiralty had information that contested the idea that the Germans wanted a medium-range engagement. Not only was it discovered that the Germans had been practising long-range firing for some years, but, in addition, early wartime encounters with German vessels, for example at the battle of the Falkland Islands, showed that they had developed considerable proficiency in it. This quickly led the Royal Navy’s top leadership to the conclusion that engagements at maximum range rather than medium range might better reflect both German capabilities and intentions and that British tactics would need to take this into account. In the light of this finding, Grand Fleet Battle Orders, which have defied obvious explanation when it was assumed that the British naval leadership expected the Germans to seek a medium-range engagement, can now be put into a more logical context.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Q6G4EMG7,2012-01-01,Matthew S.

The Eisenhower administration's decision to deploy Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBMs) on the territory of NATO allies sought to redress the perceived vulnerability until American ICBMs were ready. British deception planners considered how to enhance the threat posed by the IRBMs. An outline plan codenamed ‘Celestial’ was intended to persuade the Soviets that the otherwise vulnerable missiles could not be readily neutralised.

Today stories are chanelled to journalists in order to promote a news agenda deemed favourable to MI5, MI6 or to the CIA, or to 'spin' the coverage of key issues. Investigative reporters often have a more adversarial relationship with the security services, seeing them as over-mighty agents of the state who should be subjected to forensic scrutiny of what they get up too - allegedly for the public good. The furore over 'rendition' of terrorist suspects by the CIA and the complicity of British agencies in this process is but one example of journalists uncovering practices that the intelligence community would rather have kept secret. The contributors to this book, drawn from former intelligence officers, the media and academia, explore this intriguing and often fraught contest, shedding light on many hitherto unknown aspects of the intriguing and symbiotic relationship between the 'second oldest profession' and the print and broadcast media. Speaking from the perspective of the journalist are Chapman Pincher and Gordon Corera (Security Editor, BBC), whose essays trace the evolving relationship between news media outlets and the government, especially with regards to advances in technology. Reporting from the perspective of the political institution are Sir David Omand, Nick Wilkinson, Michael Goodman, and Anthony Campbell, who explain governmental oversight of intelligence agencies, the operation of clandestine information units, and the laws that govern the control of information. Richard Aldrich investigates the exploitation of the globalized media by intelligence agencies; Scott Lucas and Steve Hewitt tackle the CIA's use of open sources for intelligence purposes; and, Wyn Bowen examines the real-world use of open source intelligence in rolling back Libya's nuclear program. Robert Dover and Pierre Lethier explore the depiction of intelligence in popular culture, a practice that helped create rendition and facilitate torture, and condition our responses to both.

Counter-intuitively, it is perhaps the first role that is most questionable. The use of single source intelligence reporting, drawn from individuals selected principally for their willingness to share secrets, may not be the best way to analyse emerging issues such as climate change, energy security and financial stability. The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) may be drawing on too narrow a range of reporting to compete with increasingly sophisticated assessments from the private sector, academia and NGOs. In any event, the JIC has less impact on policy than is often imagined. The second task of ‘global networker’ is better-suited to the intelligence community's ability to combine human intelligence with communications intelligence and bulk data gathering, and is producing results. The third task of helping other countries to enforce the law and resist insurgency is proceeding on an ad hoc basis with occasional successes, but requires co-ordination across Whitehall so that improvements in the capabilities of other countries' intelligence services are accompanied by improved police and justice systems and enhanced oversight.

failures. Proposals to improve Intelligence Analysis have had little impact as analysts, their
managers and their organisations continue to cling to outdated threat perceptions,
methodologies and organisational structures and cultures. This thesis looks through the lens of
Knowledge Management at the various challenges that the Intelligence Analysis practice is
faced with in the Knowledge Age. Firstly, theories and concepts from Intelligence Analysis
are challenged when compared with those in Knowledge Management and the possibility of
applying new vocabularies in intelligence is discussed. The second challenge intelligence
analysts face is to understand and adapt to the changed world with its connected, non-linear
and rapidly enfolding events and patterns which broadens their scope to a multi-faceted,
complex and multi-disciplinary threat picture. The third challenge is to re-look the existing
analytical methodologies, tools and techniques, realising that these are most probably
inadequate in a complex environment. The fourth challenge Intelligence Analysis faces is to
reach out to other disciplines and assess how new analytical techniques, both intuitive and
structured, as well as cognitive models, collaborative and organisational structure concepts
from within the Knowledge Management discipline can improve Intelligence Analysis’ grasp
of the Knowledge Age. In conclusion, it is argued that intelligence analysts might be ready to
reinvent themselves to address Knowledge Age issues, but that intelligence organisations are
not able to support a new intelligence paradigm while still clinging to threat perceptions and
structures befitting the Cold War.
AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING:
Die internasionale intelligensie gemeenskap steier steeds na verskeie intelligensie terugslae
die afgelope dekade. Voorstelle om intelligensie analise te verbeter het weinig impak terwyl
analiste, hulle bestuurders en organisasies voortgaan om vas te hou aan uitgediende
bedreigingsperspesies, analitiese metodes en organisatoriese strukture en kulture. Deur die
lens van Kennis Bestuur, poog hierdie verhandeling om die verskeie uitdagings wat die
Intelligensie Analise praktyk in die Kennis Era in die gesig staar, te identifiseer. Eerstens
word bestaande teorieë en konsepte in Intelligensie Analise met dié in Kennis Bestuur
vergelyk en die moontlikheid van ‘n nuwe woordeskat vir intelligensie word bespreek. Die
tweede uitdaging vir intelligensie analiste is om by die nuwe wêreld en versnellende
verandering aan te pas. Hulle word nou gekonfronteer met ‘n bedreigingsprent wat
veelvlakkig, kompleks en multi-dissiplinêr is. Die derde uitdaging is om die bestaande
analitiese metodologiëe, hulpmiddels en tegnieke te herwaardeer in die lig van hierdie nuwe
wêreld. Die vierde uitdaging is om na ander dissiplines, insluitend dié van Kennis Bestuur, uit
te reik sodat Intelligensie Analise verbeter kan word deur die toepassing van hierdie
dissiplines se analitiese metodes (beide intuitief en gestruktureerd), hul kognitiewe en
samewerkings modelle, sowel as organisasie struktuur konsepte. Laastens word
geargumenteer dat Intelligensie Analiste dalk gereed is om hulself te vernuwe, maar dat hul
intelligensie organisasies nie ‘n nuwe intelligensie paradigma kan ondersteun terwyl hulle

Open sources exploded and with it the old OSINT model of observing and understanding ‘broadcast’ sources came under unmanageable strain. The social media entrepreneurs, feeling their way to making money from Metcalfe’s Law, added a new paradigm to the increasingly cluttered OSINT landscape – that of the ‘many to many’ interaction. Recognising the OSINT impact of the social media’s ‘many to many’ paradigm has led a former senior member of the UK intelligence community, and a noted academic, to coin the term Social Media Intelligence – social media intelligence. OSINT has clearly delivered value to its users for more than a millennium, transcending the revolutions of print, the telegraph and analogue broadcast media.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/WXKNXVF9,2019,Chris Westcott,Routledge,,2023-12-26T20:11:15Z,['H28QZ8XV']

Budgets became tighter, individuals and institutions became more risk averse and inward looking, and cost/benefit calculations regarding the relationship changed.

With case studies from across the world, the Routledge International Handbook of Universities, Security and Intelligence Studies provides a comparative, in-depth analysis of the historical and contemporary relationships between global universities, national security and intelligence agencies.

Written by leading international experts and from multidisciplinary perspectives, the Routledge International Handbook of Universities, Security and Intelligence Studies provides theoretical, methodological and empirical definition to academic, scholarly and research enquiry at the interface of higher education, security and intelligence studies. 

Divided into eight sections, the Handbook explores themes such as:



the intellectual frame for our understanding of the university-security-intelligence network;


historical, contemporary and future-looking interactions from across the globe;


accounts of individuals who represent the broader landscape between universities and the security and intelligence agencies; 


the reciprocal interplay of personnel from universities to the security and intelligence agencies and vice versa; 



the practical goals of scholarship, research and teaching of security and intelligence both from within universities and the agencies themselves; 


terrorism research as an important dimension of security and intelligence within and beyond universities;



the implication of security and intelligence in diplomacy, journalism and as an element of public policy;



the extent to which security and intelligence practice, research and study far exceeds the traditional remit of commonly held notions of security and intelligence.

It has been assumed that Klaus Fuchs could not have provided significant information to the Soviet Union regarding the hydrogen bomb because the calculations he took with him from Los Alamos were flawed. Recent evidence from British, American and former Soviet sources suggest that Fuchs played an invaluable role in the early development of thermonuclear weapons in all three countries. This article considers this new evidence and places Fuchs' role in the development of the H-bomb in the context of intelligence estimates that arose following his arrest.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ECJ84QCX,2003/09/01,Michael S.

However, British intelligence had to rely on more overt methods of intelligence collection, which provided an inadequate basis from which to proceed. This was further hindered by the interpretation of such information on the basis of Anglo-American development and by the 1946 McMahon Act. Accordingly the first Soviet atomic bomb in August 1949 was not accurately predicted by the British. Meanwhile British war planning centred on the year 1957, based – it was argued – on strategic forecasts. Yet the impact of recently released intelligence material throws this into question, and instead reveals that the date reflected British war readiness, rather than when British intelligence predicted the Soviet Union would have achieved the nuclear capability to wage a successful war.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YW23RTJE,2003-06-01,Michael Goodman,,Journal of Strategic Studies,2023-12-26T19:22:25Z,['CZT6L9T7']

It concludes that the estimates made by British observers in Japan and officially accepted by the war office were far more accurate than is usually recognized. Professional British analysts not only understood their enemy but often were sentimental Japanophiles. Their reports are a valuable source on the training, tactics and preparations of the Japanese Army between the wars. This article examines the process of observation, generalization, analysis and synthesis involved in estimation and the intellectual framework and images of Japan which shaped that process. It shows that these assessments were not dominated by racist ideology. Instead, forms of ethnocentrism and ideas of “national character” were the main cause for errors by the professionals, and these errors were not substantial. This article also demonstrates that another school of thought about the Japanese Army persisted among British officers, whose views were far less accurate than those of the professionals and far more influenced by vulgar racism. This article shows how it was that by 1941 this second school came to dominate the views of the Japanese Army held by British garrisons in Asia, but not by the war office.

It would seem obvious that there can (St. Thomas Aquinas might have begun like this, could he have been persuaded to extend his discussion of the just war
                        1
                      to include intelligence as well as deception), for otherwise an ignorant general is as good as a well informed one. But, following the method of the Summa Theologica St. Thomas would at once have objected that such a correlation would degrade strategy into mere reaction to known enemy intentions and preclude the seizing of the initiative, which is absurd. The truth, as so often, lies somewhere in the middle. There is such a correlation, but it can never be very close. The most prominent of several reasons for this is the need to leave room in the theory for considerations of policy and resources, space and time. To say this is not blindly to accept Clausewitz’s disparagement: ‘Most Intelligence is false’, so that ‘for lack of objective knowledge one has to trust to talent or to luck’

                      – a view which was no doubt scarcely an exaggeration in his time but one which Sigint has substantially discredited today – but rather to emphasize anew his best-known dictum of all: ‘War is the continuation of policy by other means’. The policy of a state, or the policy mutually agreed between a state and its allies, will specify objectives to be sought. The presence or absence of the means to achieve them will be the first qualification, the first guideline to action; intelligence about the enemy comes next, but it can seldom or never dictate the objective. The single greatest decision of the Second World War – at any rate apart from the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan – was the ‘Germany first’ decision taken by Allied agreement at the Washington conference in December 1941, and that owed nothing to intelligence. The same holds good for Torch, the invasion of North Africa, which was the British Gymnast plan of the previous year turned through 180° to meet the new circumstances of the American alliance, and for the later invasions of Italy and France. Not even the choice of particular landing beaches in Sicily, at Salerno or in Normandy derived from knowledge of enemy locations, which could and did change long after plans for Husky, Avalanche and Overlord were firmly settled. It might even be argued that the Baytown landing in the toe of Italy in September 1943 was conducted – though perhaps not planned – quite contrary to the available intelligence, for Ultra

The reason was that the convoy was ordered to scatter. The effect of an order to scatter is for its constitutent ships to abandon their close and disciplined formation and to proceed on separate, predetermined and diverging courses to their individual destinations. It was a recognized tactic for a convoy attacked by superior surface forces on the broad oceans and had been successfully used in 1940 by convoy HX 84 in the North Atlantic when, thanks to the sacrifice of its sole escort, the Armed Merchant Cruiser Jervis Bay, the great majority of the convoy had been enabled to escape from the 11-inch guns of the pocket battleship Admiral Scheer. But PQ 17 was not sailing on the vast expanse on the North Atlantic: it was on its way to North Russia, penned in to the north by the Arctic ice and to the south by the hostile Norwegian coast. It was under constant observation and attack by U-boats and aircraft. Evasion was impossible: disaster was inevitable unless the convoy and escort stuck together and somehow fought their way through to Murmansk. In the event only eleven merchant ships and two rescue ships, out of the total of 34 British, Dutch, American and Russian merchant ships and three rescue ships finally struggled into North Russian ports. No ship of the escort was sunk. Apart from a few aircraft the Germans also suffered no losses. It was a humiliating defeat for the Royal Navy, bitterly resented by its officers and men, and a shattering blow to the morale of all Allied merchant seamen. The decision to order the convoy to scatter, which deprived its escort of any possibility of protecting it, was taken by none other than the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty, the professional head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound. It was taken, so far as can be seen, against the advice of almost all his staff and against the wishes of Sir John Tovey, Commander in Chief of the Home Fleet, of Rear-Admiral Hamilton, commanding the cruiser covering force and of Commander J.E. Broome, commander of the close escort. Pound believed, in the light of the intelligence available to him, that unless the convoy scattered, every ship in it, and all its escorts, would be sunk not so much by air and U-boat attack as by the overpowering strength of a German surface ship task force centred on the battleship Tirpitz.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YVXJPJWV,1990,Patrick Beesly,Routledge,,2023-12-26T18:53:55Z,['SCCGXHMZ']

covert action as a policy option. During this same period, the single most signiﬁcant change
in the military services has been the expansion, in both size and responsibility, of its special

information gathering, not doing things to people; no-one gets hurt by it, at least not directly.

activities where adversaries’ secrets are involved. In terms of international relations, the role
is, therefore, necessarily competitive if not aggressive. Intelligence is able, to pull out a few
examples, to (a) maximise the eﬀectiveness of your own armed forces by illuminating others’
capabilities and dispositions; (b) to secure comparative political or strategic advantage internationally by disclosing others’ intentions; or (c) to protect the safety and well-being ﬁrst and

intelligence, oﬀers a useful taxonomy, arguing that we can think about intelligence in three
ways. First, as process, through which intelligence is requested by policy-makers or operational commanders, then collected, analysed and fed to the consumers. This is often
referred to as the intelligence cycle. Second, we can deﬁne it as product, once upon a time
circulated as paper, but now increasingly distributed through multi-level secure electronic
databases. Finally, we can talk of intelligence services and intelligence communities as
institutions. However, as their name implies, these organisations that provide an intelligence
service to government also conduct activities that go far beyond the mere collection of
information, as we shall discover in this volume.2",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9VX6MZ9S,2008,,Routledge,,2023-12-26T17:57:48Z,['HCN8YFI8']

All throughout this half century, the maintenance of national security posed many questions concerning its necessity as well as the most effective means of sustaining it. Indeed, the extent of sabotage and subversion and the constitutional oversight of those agencies charged with detecting and deterring it have constituted an enduring problem for Australian democratic self-understanding. This pursuit of national security exposed a paradox in the core of Australian democracy, namely, that the practice of political freedom entails the proscription of those dedicated to undermining it. The lack of conviction of successive Australian governments on the need for security and intelligence organizations and the public apathy on the part of Australians furthered this paradox. This article discusses Australian intelligence and national security. It examines the context in which the understanding of Australian national security evolved to address the unique threat environment the island continent inhabits.

The Israel Mossad has become the leading agency in Israel's success in the conflict with the Arab states. Its mission not only includes that of ascertaining the plans and strengths of the Arab military forces opposing Israel but also the work of combating Arab terrorism in Israel and abroad against Israeli and Jewish targets, collecting sensitive technical data, and conducting political-liaison and propaganda operations. The Israel intelligence community is composed of four separate components: the Mossad is responsible for intelligence gathering and operations in foreign countries; the Israeli Security Agency controls internal security and intelligence within the occupied territories; the Military Intelligence is responsible for collecting military, geographic, and economic intelligence, particularly in the Arab world and along Israel's borders; and the Center for Political Research in the Foreign Ministry prepares analysis for government policymakers based on raw intelligence and analytical papers.

Unlike other intelligence services of other nations, Germany has no separate military intelligence. The BND serves as Germany's sole foreign and military espionage agency. It also does not have an acknowledged capacity of covert operations compared to the intelligence agencies of other nations. The BND was established in 1956 as part of the West German rearmament within the NATO framework; however, by the time of its establishment the Bonn government had already abandoned its previous efforts to build a military intelligence organization from scratch and with people of its own. Because of this, the BND was under American operational control during the Cold War and German intelligence professionals have served as mercenaries for the Americans over a period of ten years, giving Americans an unique intelligence asset inside the West German government.

The establishment of the position of the director and the CIA under the law in 1947 was aimed to help avoid the another Pearl Harbor attack by taking strategic intelligence functions from separate departments and elevating them to the national level. The director was to have been the only adviser to the president with the institutional capability of presenting him with unbiased and non-departmental intelligence. The phrases in the National Security Act, however, only gave the director the potential to be leader of the intelligence community. Whether a director came close to being one was a result of the interplay of politics, personalities, and world events. With the line of authority only over the CIA, the director depended upon his powers of bureaucratic persuasion and his political clout at the White House to be heard and heeded.

In the twentieth century, with the rise of totalitarian regimes whose first order of business was information control in the service of state security, even the flows of information formerly available, were closed off. This development forced responses even from democratic states. One direct consequence was the development of better and more complex intelligence organizations to collect, evaluate, and analyze information. The other, slightly more indirect, was the increase in the emphasis on covertly acquired information, with the resulting devaluation of information openly acquired. This development, in the Second World War, accelerated in the Cold War, especially in what became a “golden age of technical intelligence”. Other topics included are: the fiduciary relationship between the analyst and client, the development of analytic research, and the ethics of twenty-first-century analysis.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/7GQVFPAT,2010-03-12,William M.

2061,Decision Advantage and the Nature of Intelligence Analysis,Book chapter,https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195375886.003.0024,"This article discusses intelligence analysis and the importance of an analyst equipped with critical thinking and sound reasoning in producing good intelligence analysis. Producing good intelligence analysis requires reasoning and critical thinking on the part of the analysts. In addition, they are also tasked with recognizing and coping with deception as well as influencing decision-makers without conveying preference on the choices available. This restraint in conveying preference should not, however, prevent the intelligence analyst from caring about his side of success or the outcomes of the policies they are supposed to inform. Successful intelligence provides advantages to decision-makers they would not otherwise have, so an analyst must know the frame of mind of the decision-maker and the strategy to help the policymaker to succeed. Intelligence is a building of the relationship of trust and collaboration between partners seeking wins for their team. Good intelligence is both subjective and objective and herein lies the essence of the analyst's conundrum: to be an expert and critical thinker, targeted for manipulation, legally denied relevant knowledge, responsible for advising, but prohibited from judging. The practice of intelligence analysis, the collection of information, the anticipation of an opponent's moves, the conveying of knowledge through assessments and estimates, and the collaboration and trust in the analyst and policymaker's relationship forms the focus of this article.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/DFYCWP48,2010-03-12,Jennifer E.

Contrary to popular opinion, this crisis in the intelligence community did not start in recent years, rather it dates back to the 1960s at a time when the U.S. intelligence on several accounts failed to provide sound national intelligence estimates. The failures of the U.S. intelligence is due to two factors: the common psychological traits which resulted in unmotivated biases in information processing which lead to systematically mistaken estimates in analysis; and the political environment of the intelligence system which has produced the notion that the intelligence product is not merely a means to achieve foreign policy goals but also a political commodity that can be used to advance political and bureaucratic interests. These biased outcomes have resulted in a bureaucratically incentivized and personally motivated manipulation in the production and use of intelligence analysis. This article discusses American intelligence failures within the broader context of American intelligence culture. It outlines eight specific aspects of this culture in order to determine the specific domains in which such intelligence estimation failures are likely to emerge. Particular focus is given on the two domains of failures: motivated and unmotivated biases.

Of the sixteen agencies of the intelligence community, the National Security Agency (NSA) faced the greatest scrutiny from the new Obama administration and the Congress. NSA was the largest and the most powerful member of the U.S. intelligence community. Since its formation in 1952, NSA has managed and directed all U.S. government signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection. It is the collector and processor of communications intelligence (COMINT) and the primary processor of foreign instrumentation signals intelligence (FISINT). And since 1958, NSA has been the coordinator of the U.S. government's national electronics intelligence (ELINT) program. It has also the task of overseeing the security of the U.S. government's communications and data processing systems, and since the 1980s, NSA has managed the U.S. government's national operation security (OPSEC) program. In this article, the focus is on the challenges faced by the NSA during the Bush administration; the role played by the NSA during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; and the challenges faced by the Obama administration in confronting a series of thorny legal and policy issues relating to NSA's eavesdropping program.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/NI35HSHU,2010-03-12,Matthew M.

Bush issued an Executive Order which reorganized and renamed the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) to President's Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB). The precursor to PFIAB and PIAB, the President's Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities was established by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. It aimed to provide the president a nonpartisan evaluation of the role and effectiveness of the U.S. intelligence collection, covert actions operation, counterintelligence, and intelligence analysis. The board has addressed three broad areas over the years. First, it assessed the impact of new technologies and innovative modes of organization to the collection and analysis of intelligence. Second, it analyzed foreign political trends. Third, it provided assessment of crisis management. Despite of the significant activities performed by the board, it remains to be the smallest and the least well-known part of the U.S. intelligence community. This article focuses on the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). It determines why it remains to be the least known part of the intelligence community and how it functions and operates. The article also discusses the evolution of the board from the perspective of the administration of Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and G. W. Bush. While the PFIAB has been doubted of its relevance, it has remained to play a useful role for both the president and the overall intelligence community. Uniquely positioned, it has a clearance to review all of the most sensitive secrets and it has direct access to the president. It is a powerful and effective tool that supports the president's efforts to implement policies, manage operations of the intelligence community, and change organizations. Although much debate has been directed on the potential and the role of the institution, it has nevertheless made important recommendations such as the establishment of DIA, CIA's Directorate of Science and Technology, and Defense Attaché system; all of which improved the intelligence system.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3GY5R8UG,2010-03-12,"Kenneth M.

Its rise was the result of the adoption of a doctrine on central intelligence. Once established, the agency achieved ascendancy in the intelligence community, acquired reputation for its successful covert operations, and developed an effective U.S. analytical capability. The agency became one of the most reputed institutions in the government circle and became the icon of American culture. However, the rise of the CIA was not devoid of failures. In the early twenty-first century, the CIA lost its former high standing. This fall of the CIA may be traced to a number of setbacks and difficulties such as: the Bay of Pigs disaster that failed to liberate Cuba from communism; the disclosures about its assassination policy, manipulation of intelligence, and malpractices; and the failure to predict the 9/11 attack and the creation of weapons of mass destruction. This article discusses the rise and fall of the CIA from its founding in 1947 to its golden years in the 1950s and to its troubled years in the 1960s. The article also discusses some of the revelations on the CIA which shocked the American nation. It also discusses the victory of the CIA during the Cold War and the reforms undertaken by the agency following the Aldrich Ames incident and following the many criticisms hurtled against the agency. The article concludes with the declining ascendancy of the CIA. The decline of the CIA rested in the agency's loss of standing. It had relinquished its ascendancy over and its independence within the intelligence community.

At the beginning, the nation's armed forces held crude notions of military intelligence. By 1977, the United States had the most sophisticated and expensive intelligence system. This rise of intelligence was the United States's response to three challenges: the growing willingness of states to hold non-combatants at risk for political ends; the startling increases in the ability of the states to wreak havoc; and the spiraling expenses in deterring enemies who possessed new powerful weapons. This article discusses the early development of the U.S. Intelligence in 1917 and its expansion to an “Intelligence Community” from 1977 onwards.

Despite negative claims on the performance of these agencies, politicians, citizens, and scholars often have little to discuss on intelligence performance. They seldom ask what the intelligence services do in aggregate; what their performance rate is; how the infrequent yet prominent failures compare to ongoing performance that is invisible to the outsiders because it is at least adequate; and how ignorance of the performance of the different types of intelligence activities affects the overall assessment of the intelligence services. This little discussion on some of the important aspects of intelligence performance resulted in the absence of general theory of intelligence performance. To judge better intelligence performance, understanding the functions and the nature of work of the intelligence services is a must.

Intelligence organizations like the CIA employ historical staff because of the idea that history aids the intelligence agency to figure out who they are by illuminating the value of the often misunderstood profession, the mistakes and achievements of the past and how they came about, and the ways to improve work and appreciation of the reasons for public criticism, distrust, and the occasional call to disband the CIA. The CIA History Staff has an external function although its most important function is internal. Even so, the internal historical function of the CIA History Staff depends on the histories and historical treatments of CIA conducted by outsiders.

Intelligence sources and the nature of information obtained vary. Intelligence sources may include information obtained from espionage, images obtained by satellites, intercepted communications, and publicly available media reporting. The nature of information may vary, from purloined documents to the “signature” of a ship's radar. The term “methods,” which is synonymous with “tradecraft,” pertains to the techniques used by operations officers and analysts to carry out their duties. Methods may include social-science methodologies, computer-based analytic tools, maintaining secretive communications, and so on. Intelligence agencies worldwide strive to protect their “sources and methods” because they are crucial to the success of ongoing and future operations and analysis, and a, comprise of the ways they collect and analyze information can give opponents a keen appreciation of their overall capabilities and interests. In the advent of globalization, the barriers are dissolved between foreign and domestic violence activities, including the ways local and national law enforcement and intelligence agencies work. Distinctions between private and public interests and entities are also blurred as activities in the public and private sphere interact to shape domestic and international threats. Apart from globalization, the advent of information revolution has also changed the practice and study of intelligence. Policymakers, analysts, and scholars are now confronted with a torrent of data and information as well as the virtual realities of “cyberspace.” New collective workspaces, which are empowered by the advancement in communication and computer technologies, are also creating new opportunities for collaboration.

2083,"The British intelligence community in Singapore, 1946-1959 : local security, regional co-ordination and the Cold War in the Far East",Thesis,https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/23515/,"Singapore was the stronghold of British intelligence in the Far East during the Cold War. The small city-colony played host to a diverse range of British intelligence organisations including regional outposts of MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), specialist technical intelligence centres, open source reporting centres and the police Special Branch. These intelligence outfits operated across three levels: the local, the regional and the national. This thesis investigates the British intelligence milieu in Singapore, focusing upon its organisation and status; its working culture and operations; and its impact or influence. In so doing, the thesis interrogates to what extent we can speak of a definable British intelligence 'community' in Singapore during the early Cold War. It concludes that there were instead two distinct communities: a local intelligence community, and a regional-national one. Nevertheless, there were two core similarities. Security intelligence was at the forefront of both communities as the most appropriate response to the nature of the Cold War both within Singapore and the Southeast Asian region. Secondly, both intelligence communities played a significant role not just in shaping official perceptions but as avenues for covert policy implementation. At the regional level, intelligence activities enabled Britain to fight the Cold War through clandestine measures, fulfilling the key policy goal of providing containment without (extensive) commitments. Locally, security intelligence was a major driving force in the engagement between the Singapore government, communist 'terrorists' and anti-colonial nationalists. This thesis is not just about British intelligence in the Cold War. It also provides original insight into Singapore's transition to self-government between 1946 and 1959 by focusing on the crucial role played by Special Branch. Intelligence services were vital in ensuring that Singapore was rendered 'safe' for decolonisation, and their activities indicate continuity between colonial and post-colonial government in Singapore.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/64ARHSV3,2019,Alexander Nicholas Shaw,,,2022-12-20T21:57:50Z,"['CZT6L9T7', 'CK5MNYPQ']"

The first is that border security was essential to the Communist police state. The police state of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) did not function properly in the years before 1961 because East Germans could escape it — either for a day or two, or forever. This is established by records of East Germany's Ministry of State Security (Ministerium für Staatssicherheit, or MfS) and, in particular, by records of its Hauptabteilung IX (Main Department IX). This was the Ministry's ‘investigation unit’ (Untersuchungsorgan); among other things, it was responsible for interrogating arrested spies. Its records are the principal source for this paper and they put the Second Berlin Crisis of 1958–63 in a new light. Espionage and subversion against the GDR were organized from a safe haven located right next to it and conducted over a border it had not yet managed to close. This was a challenge which the Soviet security service had not faced since the Bolshevik regime had signed the Treaty of Brest—Litovsk in 1918.

It analyses the performance of French security services confronted with violent unrest and communal rebellion in Morocco and Syria in the 1920s. The paper addresses fundamental questions about power in a colonial state. What was the relationship between intelligence agencies and the coercive instruments of imperial power? How far did intelligence-gathering help to maintain state authority? And what role did intelligence agencies play as architects of colonial state formation? In the French Moroccan protectorate and the Syrian mandate, the local security services — military intelligence officers, Arabic-speaking tribal control specialists, and the secret police units of the Sûreté Générale and the Special Branch — had clear ideas about the answers to each of these questions. Using the Moroccan and Syrian examples, the central proposition of the paper is that the inter-war protectorates, mandates and colonies stretching in an arc through the Arab world were ‘intelligence states’, a concept that the paper will seek to develop.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FC9WNIE6,2008,Martin Thomas,Routledge,,2023-12-26T17:28:23Z,['MP7FJ9UA']

Within democratic countries the principle of legislative oversight of intelligence makes a certain kind of a priori sense, being naturally consistent with the broader practices of political accountability in both parliamentary and Hamiltonian models of representative government (and the many hybrid forms that have developed over the last century or so). There is legislative oversight of foreign, economic, fiscal, environmental and defence policy, and so the idea of having bodies of legislators overseeing the intelligence services seems only natural. Within such a matter of principle, the only question is really whether the intelligence services require their own separate legislative bodies (as has increasingly been the practice in the United States since the Church Committee reports to Congress in 1975 and 1976) or whether the agencies, with their diverse technical and geographical jurisdictions, might be more easily subsumed under existing legislative committees. In other words, oversight could be distributed between committees on foreign affairs for overseas espionage, home affairs for domestic security intelligence, defence for activities in support of the armed services, and finance or appropriations for their budgets (as was American practice prior to 1975,
                     1

                  ). The problem, however, is far from being so simple. The collection, processing and management of secret intelligence is a very special category of activity. Espionage in a democracy happens on the boundaries of democracy, at the frontiers of civil society where the opponents of liberal government seek to exploit basic civil liberties to undermine the political order that makes those freedoms possible.

It focuses our attention on the hubris of the powerful, and the bad judgment and risk-taking it spawns. Tragedy also emphasizes the ways in which well-intentioned initiatives often produce outcomes diametrically opposed to those that were envisaged. The tragic poets attribute such outcomes to competing, and often irreconcilable, ethical perspectives, and to the inherent complexity of social relations, which makes it impossible to foresee with confidence the implications of one's behavior.

For some this takes the form of a crisis of legitimacy. For others the threat of cataclysmic terrorism involving chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack gives added poignancy to the academic contention that intelligence failure is inevitable. Many of the challenges facing intelligence appear to be both new and deeply worrying. In response, intelligence has clearly taken on new forms and new agendas. How these various developments are viewed depends upon the historical, normative and political frameworks in which they are analysed. This book addresses fundamental questions arising in this new age.
The central aim of the collection is to identify key issues and questions and subject them to interrogation from different methodological perspectives using internationally acclaimed experts in the field. A key focus in the collection is on British and North American perspectives. Recent trends and debates about the organisation and conduct of intelligence provide key themes for exploration. Underpinning several contributions is the recognition that intelligence faces a conflict of ideas as much as practices and threats.

varying importance. They rarely stood in the first rank of imperial concerns,
but sometimes in the second. Nor are these matters easy to assess. They
involve the interaction between many actors and factors, such as rule in and
rulers over India and Africa, or observation, intelligence, perception,
learning, fear, ignorance and uncertainty. Causes and effects are hard to
disentangle. The records are rife with strange reports, which often hold
truth. Their study requires generalization, risking overgeneralization.

modernization of all peoples on western (especially British) lines, including

handle as a whole, or individually. Thus, racism had simple effects at lower
levels of decision making, but complex results at higher ones. The evidence is
filled with language or logic which was, or can be seen as being, racist or
Orientalist, but they must be treated as problems, not as self-evident. Decision
makers held many opinions about Muslim peoples, who were not seen as one
unchanging ‘other’. There always was a debate over these issues. Imperial
knowledge altered over time. Often it simply was knowledge. These issues are
an unknown part of the history for a matter with contemporary resonance.

It discusses the publically available documentation, which now includes almost all the material on the matter, though the data base has been permanently destroyed in significant ways. The paper traces the development of British intelligence between 1869–1939, involving the transition from a tradition to a system of intelligence, with the greatest change occurring during the Fist World War. The article assesses how, between 1914–39, intelligence was interrelated to bureaucratic politics, modes of decision making, and the formulation of strategic politics, modes of decision making, and the formulation of strategic policy. It discusses the structure and power of British intelligence agencies between 1919–39, their quality compared to rivals in other countries, and the impact on policy of their successes and failures.

In Russia and the Balkans, 1870–1880 (1937), for example, B. H. Sumner integrated intelligence and diplomacy as well as any subsequent writer.2 Meanwhile, beginning in the later nineteenth century, the genre of spy fiction began to flourish.

It is the collection, collation and analysis of information so to help one use resources well in competitions with rivals. Intelligence is not a form of power, but a guide to its use. Intelligence is not collected for its own sake, but to support action. It does not win wars, but it can help generals to do so, by serving as a force multiplier, or by letting one know one’s options and choose a good one. It has offered advantages to States for millennia, though not consistently—here essential to events, there irrelevant. Most States have received some intelligence sometimes, but not always from permanent and specialized agencies, and they have not always assessed it through bureaucracies. Until 1860, staffs were a secretariat, while commanders handled even minor functions of command. They organized the collection of their own intelligence, working through ad hoc means and a few aides; so did prime ministers and kings. This approach had advantages. Decision-makers could direct their intelligence and receive exactly the information they wanted; despite their lack of technological resources, the best personalized systems matched any bureaucratized ones of the twentieth century. Most pre-modern systems, however, were worse than mediocre modern ones, because intelligence was not thoroughly collected and assessed. By 1914, bureaucracy and technology enabled a revolution in intelligence, which rose sharply in significance and, along with other factors, transformed the nature of power and the working of war. Some see another such revolution in military intelligence occurring today.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6LSHHPZX,2010,John Ferris,Routledge,,2023-12-26T16:41:04Z,['HCN8YFI8']

This week, Justin sits down with author, professor, historian and former intelligence analyst for the state department and the CIA, Dr. Mark Stout.  Today, Mark shares his research on a mysterious early US intelligence entity known as the Pond. The Pond was a secret organization operating between 1942 and 1955, though its existence wasn't formally acknowledged by the US government until 2001. Headed by John V. Grombach, the Pond's unique espionage style was markedly different from the OSS and the CIA, though the quality of its intel has been brought to question. In the end, Grombach was his own worst enemy as his stark world view led to personality clashes  with the CIA, ultimately playing a major role in the end of the Pond.Connect with Mark:spymuseum.orgTwitter: @WWIPhDCheck some of Mark's articles on War on the Rocks, here.https://warontherocks.com/author/mark-stout/Connect with Spycraft 101:Check out Justin's latest release, Covert Arms, here.spycraft101.comIG: @spycraft101Shop: spycraft-101.myshopify.comPatreon: Spycraft 101Find Justin's first book, Spyshots: Volume One, here.Download the free eBook, The Clandestine Operative's Sidearm of Choice, here.Support the show",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/LL9Y2STQ,2022-05-02T04:00:00Z,,,,2023-12-26T14:38:00Z,['SCCGXHMZ']

These had a noticeable impact on the writing of spy stories, which under the influence of new detail and knowledge tended to become more realistic. The following article examines the influence of spy memoirs on spy fiction in the period, revealing that both critics and the reading public were now forced to disentangle fact from fakery and trying to pinpoint where truth bled into fiction. Attention is given to the three ‘spy memoirs’ of Bernard Newman, Spy (1935), Secret Servant (1935) and German Spy (1936). These unjustly forgotten works of fiction disguised as fact generated some confusion and debate at the time and served to draw attention to issues of authenticity when treating ‘writers in intelligence’.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/2S8LX5SY,2023-12-18,Alan Burton,,Intelligence and National Security,2023-12-26T11:01:54Z,['9YH9YSYQ']

Moreover, surveillance technology is expanding throughout the region as national and local governments seek to increase their capacity to monitor and control their populations—a trend that has been aggravated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This article assesses the risks posed by smart cities to democratic institutions and processes by identifying the main models of smart city development and how they conceive of the state and citizens’ relationship, then assessing how smart cities can potentially foster and consolidate digital authoritarianism, with a particular focus on the technology that a regime can exploit to pursue illiberal goals.

After Fisher was swapped for the downed CIA U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers and an American PhD student Frederic Pryor in 1962, the KGB attempted to turn the setback into a public relations victory by constructing the myth of an ideal Soviet intelligence officer. However, the myth required that Fisher continue his public life under the assumed identity of Rudolf Abel until his death and beyond. Drawing on KGB archival documents, memoirs of former KGB officers, Fisher’s published personal letters, and Russian language journalistic accounts, this article chronicles and analyses both the KGB activities to make Fisher into the mythic Abel and the former officer’s seemingly hopeless but remarkably persistent struggle to preserve his personal identity and integrity.

Seeking to connect an analysis of intelligence liaison with the wider realm of Anglo-American Relations, the book draws on a wide range of interviews and consultations with key actors in both countries. The book is centred around two critical and empirical case studies, focusing on the interactions on the key issues of counterterrorism and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) counter-proliferation. These case studies provide substantive insights into a range of interactions such as 9/11, the 7/7 London bombings, the A.Q. Khan nuclear network, the prelude to the 2003 Iraq War, extraordinary rendition and special forces deployments. Drawing on over 60 interviews conducted in the UK and US with prominent decision-makers and practitioners, these issues are examined in the contemporary historical context, with the main focus being on the years 2000-05.

2122,"“Vox clamantis in deserto?” The evolution of Britain’s foreign intelligence and security structures, 1870-1914",Thesis,https://theses.gla.ac.uk/82755/,"This thesis examines the evolutionary process of Britain’s foreign intelligence organisations from 1870 to 1914. There were three main drivers behind the development of British foreign intelligence through this period. These were: the influence of political and administrative culture; the apathy of the military establishment; and the involvement of intelligence officers within policymaking. These latter two steps were guided by the effect of British political and administrative culture. These twin cultural influences informed the character of Britain’s foreign intelligence structures, along with Britain’s nascent intelligence culture, as they adopted state governance principles. Inter-departmentalism, involvement within the ‘committee system’, cooperation, and achieving consensus were, to varying degrees, the defining principles of Britain’s burgeoning intelligence machinery. These principles served to impel the animosity of the military establishment, while facilitating the intelligence institutions’ involvement with the civilian sphere and policymaking. By 1914 Britain’s foreign intelligence structures had become incorporated into the civilian sphere, acting as bridges between the civilian and military spheres of the British state facilitating the flow of information in both directions. This thesis will illustrate how important an influence a nation’s political and administrative culture can be upon the evolution of its intelligence agencies. The period from 1870 to 1914 laid the foundations for the shape and character of Britain’s modern intelligence community, establishing principles and an intelligence culture that persist to this day.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YP4U5SE3,2022-04-06,Adam Gordon,,,2022-12-27T23:22:38Z,"['9DTPTK46', '4BH8AYZE']"

2128,In Spies We Trust: The Story of Western Intelligence,Book,,"In Spies We Trust reveals the full story of the Anglo-American intelligence relationship - ranging from the deceits of World War I to the mendacities of 9/11 - for the first time.Why did we ever start trusting spies? It all started a hundred years ago. First we put our faith in them to help win wars, then we turned against the bloodshed and expense, and asked our spies instead to deliver peace and security. By the end of World War II, Britain and America were cooperating effectively to that end. At its peak in the 1940s and 1950s, the ""special intelligence relationship"" contributed to national and international security in what was an Anglo-American century.But from the 1960s this ""special relationship"" went into decline. Britain weakened, American attitudes changed, and the fall of the Soviet Union dissolved the fear that bound London and Washington together. A series of intelligence scandals along the way further eroded public confidence. Yet even in these years, the US offered its old intelligence partner a vital gift: congressional attempts to oversee the CIA in the 1970s encouraged subsequent moves towards more open government in Britain and beyond. So which way do we look now? And what are the alternatives to the British-American intelligence relationship that held sway in the West for so much of the twentieth century? Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones shows that there are a number - the most promising of which, astonishingly, remain largely unknown to the Anglophone world.

It all started a hundred years ago. First we put our faith in them to help win wars, then we turned against the bloodshed and expense, and asked our spies instead to deliver peace and security. By the end of World War II, Britain and America were cooperating effectively to that end. At its peak in the 1940s and 1950s, the ""special intelligence relationship"" contributed to national and international security in what was an Anglo-American century.But from the 1960s this ""special relationship"" went into decline. Britain weakened, American attitudes changed, and the fall of the Soviet Union dissolved the fear that bound London and Washington together. A series of intelligence scandals along the way further eroded public confidence. Yet even in these years, the US offered its old intelligence partner a vital gift: congressional attempts to oversee the CIA in the 1970s encouraged subsequent moves towards more open government in Britain and beyond. So which way do we look now? And what are the alternatives to the British-American intelligence relationship that held sway in the West for so much of the twentieth century? Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones shows that there are a number - the most promising of which, astonishingly, remain largely unknown to the Anglophone world.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/8U8UIG97,2015-10-06,Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones,Oxford University Press,,2023-12-23T23:27:31Z,"['CZT6L9T7', 'BNPYHVD4', 'MP7FJ9UA', 'SCCGXHMZ', 'WHBCJ8GW']"

The British did not make this knowledge public at that time, nor did they use their still classified records during the war crimes trials after the end of World War II.

Commentators more expert than I have addressed themselves to the question of whether the British had a legal obligation to disclose the information from the coded messages. These remarks concentrate on the possible moral responsibility of the British government, and they briefly address the responsibilities of modern governments whose intelligence services discover genocide.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/32FJC6D4,1998-01-01,Kent Greenawalt,,Cardozo L.

This historical plot testifies to the clash between the colonial branches of the British,German and United States intelligence services through clandestine operations in the Spanish Guinean colony. Addressing the issue of the perception of Spanish Guinea by the intelligence services of the various belligerent European powers, this article highlights the factors behind the apprehension of sub-Saharan Africa as a theatre of operations in the Second World War. The archival sources and the bibliographic data analysed from the perspective of Intelligence Studies, revealed the consideration of the colony of Spanish Guinea as a target of paramount importance by the German, French, British and American units in charge of the underground war, an offensive strategy, which inaugurated a new paradigm from military and security view points for Cameroon under the League of Nations trusteeship.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6HK7TU42,2023-01-04,Saliou Abba,,Scientia Militaria: South African Journal of Military Studies,2023-12-23T23:17:57Z,"['RHJFPRAI', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"
2131,Spying Gender: Women in British Intelligence 1969-1994,Thesis,https://research.aber.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/spying-gender,"While women have long been a part of the intelligence world, their roles in shaping contemporary intelligence organisation and practices have often been minimised, overlooked, or altogether erased. When their work is acknowledged, it is often through archetypical depictions of femme fatales or ingénues. As a result, the history of women in contemporary intelligence is piecemeal, and with few exceptions, women’s voices and experiences are missing from intelligence histories. This thesis explores the history of women in modern intelligence, centred on the British Security Service, MI5, from 1969 to 1994, a time period which contained many of the most significant changes for women in the organisation. This thesis addresses how structural and societal factors, in combination with organisational policies, practices, and cultures shaped women’s experiences in modern intelligence employment. Sources include autobiographical writing and public speaking events such as lectures, panel discussions, television and radio broadcasts. This analysis demonstrates the importance of women’s employment to studies of intelligence history and organisation and explores the interconnectedness of larger structural factors within women’s everyday lives and employment. Incorporating an interdisciplinary approach to women’s and gender history, this thesis draws from intersectional feminist theory, research on women’s employment and labour market participation, organisational and business management studies, and critical intelligence studies. This thesis argues that women’s narratives exist at a nexus of macro, meso and micro level forces and that these experiences are uniquely positioned to highlight how contemporary intelligence organisations have been shaped by women employees. In an ongoing fight for equality of opportunity, women have challenged and changed policies and practices which hindered their progression, including the gender coding of certain job roles. Foregrounding women’s experiences in intelligence work allows us to discern these changes in ways that are not as visible if we only consider the experiences of men.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/QJV6HCKW,2019,Jessica Shahan,,,2023-12-23T23:10:12Z,['HCN8YFI8']

It considers this development within the wider context of security intelligence in relation to British India, which has been the subject of increased academic study in recent years as a result of the increased availability of relevant archival material. The need for CIS to be established draws attention to the parameters within which the various intelligence and security agencies operated, their attention focused primarily upon clearly identifiable threats to British rule, particularly nationalism and communism. The issue of covert Chinese activity in India did not fit easily within this framework; the manner in which SOE’s concerns were ultimately addressed illustrates how the prevailing colonial security mindset shaped the conceptual horizons of security intelligence activity.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/MESM29EX,2016-11-01,Christopher J.

The challenge mounted by the Italian government to the British imperial structure rested upon the development of preferential relations with nationalist movements throughout the empire; such relationship would be forged by propaganda in a region, the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean, which was central to Mussolini’s foreign policy. The promotion of Fascist ideology among the Middle Eastern populations, and in particular in Egypt and Palestine, was driven by political priorities rather than ideological imperatives insofar as propaganda was carefully employed to expand the economic and military capacity of Fascist Italy. Thus propaganda became as early as the 1920s an instrument of foreign policy. This article also questions the effectiveness of Britain’s response to the Fascist challenge: here structural problems within the British propaganda machine and intelligence community seriously undermined Britain’s defence against Axis subversion in the Middle East.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/WZW5EDUB,2013-02-21,Manuela Williams,,Eunomia.

The analysis maintained that the relationship was based on deeply established cooperation in defense, diplomacy and intelligence, and that despite recent problems Britain would remain of unparalleled importance as an American ally. The immediate impact of the memorandum in the White House of Lyndon B.

Contrary to the previous portrayal of Pollard, a genial, rough-and-ready gung-ho ‘adventurer’ who flew the future Caudillo to Morocco on a whim, the files reveal Pollard to have been an experienced British intelligence officer, talented linguist, and firearms expert with considerable firsthand experience of wars and revolutions in Mexico, Morocco, and Ireland, where he had served as a police adviser in Dublin Castle during the ‘stormy days’ of the Black and Tans in the early 1920s. Pollard, who listed his hobbies in Who's Who as ‘hunting and shooting’, was the sporting editor of Country Life and a member of Lord Leconfield's hunt. He was also a renowned and passionate firearms expert having written numerous books on the subject including the section on ‘small arms’ for the official war office textbook.

The hub of this activity was Lourenço Marques, the colonial capital of Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique). One of the key tasks of Axis agents was to make links with Nazi sympathizers and the radical right in South Africa, promote dissent, and destabilize the imperial war effort in the dominion. Using British, American, and South African archival sources, this article outlines German espionage activities and British counter-intelligence operations orchestrated by MI5, MI6, and the Special Operations Executive between 1939 and 1944. The article, which is part of a larger study, examines three broad themes. First, it explores Pretoria's creation of a humble military intelligence apparatus in wartime South Africa. Secondly, it examines the establishment of several British liaison and intelligence-gathering agencies that operated in southern Africa for most of the war. Finally, it assesses the working relationship between the South African and British agencies, the tensions that arose, and the competing interests that emerged between the two allies as they sought to contain the Axis-inspired threat from within.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/4S3IYPTW,2005-03-21,Kent Fedorowich,,The Historical Journal,2023-12-23T22:59:33Z,['SCCGXHMZ']

Its central argument is that despite the widespread backlash against the use of the 'five techniques' in Northern Ireland, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in Britain continued to support their use because of their benefits to intelligence-gathering. By examining the written histories of the 'five techniques' commissioned by the MoD and the course of MoD-led debates on the purposes of the techniques, we can gain an insight into official attitudes towards past and future uses of the techniques. Bolstered by evidence on the quantity and quality of the intelligence these techniques produced in the Northern Ireland case, this study contributes to debates on the relationship between intelligence-gathering and interrogation methods that can be described as ill-treatment or torture.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6EZTFXLW,2009-11-01,Samantha Newbery,,Irish Studies in International Affairs,2023-12-23T22:58:17Z,['V7KUA58M']

A contextual overview of the two allied intelligence services prior to and following the outbreak of war highlights their complementary strength and global reach. The tactical and strategic significance of French and British intelligence failures at the time of the first German poison gas attacks in April 1915 is examined and contrasted with subsequent allied experience. The discussion focuses upon the two most productive sources of allied intelligence information, mainly reports from secret agents and enemy prisoner of war interview digests. The volume, quality and detail of this material, and its importance to the Franco-British gas war effort are underlined.

The possibility of a surprise attack by the numerically superior Warsaw Pact forces ensured that great importance was attached to intelligence, warning and rapid mobilisation. As yet we know very little about the intelligence dimension of BAOR and its interface with NATO allies. This article attempts to address these neglected issues, ending with the impact of the 1973 Yom Kippur War upon NATO thinking about warning and surprise in the mid-1970s. It concludes that the arrangements made by Whitehall for support to BAOR from national assets during crisis or transition to war were – at best – improbable.

Led by the exceptionally able François de Levis, the French hoped to surprise Murray’s outnumbered and isolated army, but even as the French embarked at Montreal on 20 May, Murray was writing that he had “received certain intelligence” of French preparations and had taken appropriate precautions. Much of this foreknowledge came from British spies working behind the French lines. Although prior to September 1759 the British had not possessed a single operative in Canada, Québec, now in British hands, became the base for a modest espionage organization which proved capable of scattering informants throughout the towns and countryside of New France and recruiting at least one agent in the confidence of the very highest officials of the colonial administration.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XWFSF7DM,2012-01-20,Peter MacLeod,,Canadian Military History,2023-12-23T22:48:39Z,['DS3WDJUS']

This thesis analyses the response of oversight institutions to the allegations, and considers their ability to provide meaningful intelligence oversight, both individually and holistically. It considers an oversight framework based on the separation of powers, in which the state institutions have complementary roles. 

This thesis argues that the existing legislative oversight framework is outdated and that although due weight should be afforded to national security concerns, the current balance lies too far in favour of the executive. Both the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) and judiciary require greater powers to provide meaningful oversight. There is also an increasing role for civil society and transnational organisations, especially given the difficulties international intelligence cooperation poses for domestic intelligence oversight.

The thesis considers: (1) the legislative oversight framework and law relating to extraordinary rendition; (2) the global intelligence landscape in which the UK intelligence and security agencies operate, and effect of increasing international intelligence cooperation; (3) executive oversight and the relationship between the executive and the UK agencies; (4) the structure and powers of the ISC, and its reports concerning extraordinary rendition; (5) the role of the judiciary within intelligence oversight, and judgments made in the context of extraordinary rendition; (6) the increasing role for non-traditional actors, including Non-Governmental and Transnational Organisations and the Press.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/CN5YWD3C,2012,Alice McDonald,,,2023-12-23T22:38:15Z,['DVEM4H4W']

The view presented is one of complete incompetence by the West. Little attention has been paid to any successes the Japanese intelligence organizations achieved. In fact, the majority of Anglo-American historians have instead focused on the errors and unpreparedness of the Allies as the cause of their early failures. This view is completely dismissive of Japanese intelligence efforts. The majority of the research does not take into account the extensive preparations and training the Japanese intelligence organizations and military undertook in the lead up to World War II. This information calls into question the assertion that Allied failures were the primary provenance of the early Japanese successes. This study focuses on the Japanese intelligence efforts from 1930 to 1942. It will analyze the events leading up to and the Invasion of Malaya. This was a pivotal event at the opening of World War II, and was a decisive Japanese victory. Previously, the success of Japanese forces during this, and other, event has been credited to failures in Allied intelligence and preparedness. Western sources at large have claimed that Japanese intelligence as a whole was faulty.

During six years of war the intelligence work carried out in Canada expanded in several areas, and included a growing capacity to carry out intelligence analysis in several fields. An analytic group was established to exploit the mass of detailed information collected by the postal censorship programme. The Department of External Affairs created a small unit that drew on signals intercepts and other sources to assess political issues for senior officials. In the Department of National Defence, the newly-created Joint Intelligence Committee took the first steps in producing strategic intelligence assessments from a Canadian perspective. These developments were all heavily influenced by Canada’s close intelligence relations with the UK and US.

2147,"The collectors : Naval, Army and Air Intelligence in the New Zealand Armed Forces during the Second World War",Thesis,https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/handle/10289/9340,"This thesis examines the performance of the intelligence collection organisations of the armed services of New Zealand during the Second World War. It considers the intelligence bodies of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force and looks at their growth, development and demise, and assesses their effectiveness as intelligence organisations. The question of how much New Zealand could be expected to achieve in the field of intelligence arises, not least because New Zealand was demographically small, had a long coastline and was geographically relatively remote. How much could New Zealand contribute to the Allied cause in intelligence terms is another issue, and what forms did any participation take? Were there lessons to be learned from the wartime experience (there were, but they went for the most part largely unheeded)? 
 
New Zealand, like other countries, had a fragmented approach to intelligence collection, making for a degree of complexity over a range of activity, despite the intelligence organisations being of modest size. The examination of the organisations in this thesis includes multi-service and multi-departmental dimensions along with the production of useful intelligence. Whether good use was made of intelligence collected is another matter. There was a substantial amount of liaison, contact and practice between departments of state as to various aspects of intelligence, the Organization for National Security and coastwatching being two notable areas. The overarching role and limitations of the Organization for National Security with regard to intelligence is explored, and the development of a combined intelligence centre examined. The participation of New Zealand signals intelligence organisations in the great Allied interception offensive is detailed, along with the mundane but fundamental task of coastal surveillance. The establishment and spectacular decline of the first local independent security service is traced. Both the intelligence and security aspects of the Army's operationally deployed units are covered, along with the growth of RNZAF air intelligence. 
 
The effectiveness of all of these organisations could hardly be expected to be uniform, and indeed it was not. Some bodies succeeded in their collection roles beyond expectations, others were reasonably effective, and two organisations failed dismally in different ways, for a number of reasons. If a pattern emerges at all, it is that small single service component-type intelligence sections collecting operational intelligence were the most effective New Zealand intelligence organisations. Operational focus and. operational requirements underlay the drive for successful collection. Most significant within the Allied context were the signals intelligence bodies. At the other end of the scale, larger co-operative interdepartmental New Zealand intelligence ventures failed to deliver projected results. 
 
New Zealand's armed forces had an interesting variety of intelligence contributions during the Second World War. Of these, the most effective organisations collected intelligence to meet directed operational requirements.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BHDHYYH9,2000,John Tonkin-Covell,,,2023-12-23T22:24:03Z,['SCCGXHMZ']
2148,"Intelligence Services, an Integral Part of States in Transition",Journal article,https://economicsandlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/vol13.-no39-1.pdf#page=141,"This article contains several reflections on the intelligence service as a system in itself, but also as an inseparable part of the state and a factor of its statehood. In the processing of this work, domestic experiences were treated, as well as opportunities in neighboring countries and beyond. Treating “service” as a part of the political system and especially studying it in a scientific sense is relatively recent. In the past (France - Fouchet; Soviet Union - Beria et al. ed.) the “service” was not only mystified, but often slandered, and not infrequently there was political reckoning with the heads of certain intelligence services. The basis for such a scientific and qualified approach to the “services” and analyzing their work, but also leaving it for “public inspection”, as far as possible, was made possible by the current resources of the political organization of each state in particular, as well as the legal and social regulations within each States. After the collapse of the “Warsaw Pact” in Yugoslavia, more precisely in the states created by its dissolution, the name of the service SDB, RDB - no longer made sense, that is, it carried with it a series of hidden digressions and even dangers. In order to prevent this from happening and to explain primitive and malicious remarks, the services were given professional and neutral names and one could always say: “We are a service of the state.” Here is the information for you as external users, so do what you want with them”! Towards the end of the twentieth century, as a result of radical geostrategic changes, which implied many transformations of security systems throughout the planet Earth, there was also a “repackaging” of the meaning of the term security.

Swedish service attachés were posted to London to use their diplomatic and service status to collect and report relevant intelligence to Swedish High Command in Stockholm for assessment and circulation. Their collection techniques in Britain meet Wilhelm Agrell’s definition of intelligence liaison and this paper describes how they were able to deliver significant results under difficult conditions. At times, they had to contend with a hostile and restrictive host country, communication difficulties (in every sense) with Stockholm and unappreciative diplomats and senior officers.

2155,Contending cultures of counterterrorism: transatlantic divergence or convergence?,Journal article,,"Terrorist attacks on the United States, Spain and the United Kingdom have underlined the differing responses of Europe and the United States to the 'new terrorism'. This article analyses these responses through the prism of historically determined strategic cultures. For the last four years the United States has directed the full resources of a `national security' approach towards this threat and has emphasized unilateralism. Europe, based on its own past experience of terrorism, has adopted a regulatory approach pursued through multilateralism. These divergences in transatlantic approaches, with potentially major implications for the future of the relationship, have appeared to be mitigated by a revised American strategy of counterterrorism that has emerged during 2005. However, this article contends that while strategic doctrines may change, the more immutable nature of strategic culture will make convergence difficult. This problem will be compounded by the fact that neither Europe nor America have yet addressed the deeper connections between terrorism and the process of globalization.

Intelligence collection by agencies such as the CIA, MI6, and Mossad involves practices that are apparently inconsistent with the principles of ordinary morality – practices such as lying, spying, manipulation, and covert action. However, in the defence of national security, such practices may not only be morally permissible, but may also under some circumstances be morally obligatory. One approach to the ethics of national security intelligence activity has been to draw from the just war tradition (so-called ‘just intelligence theory’). This book identifies significant limitations of this approach and offers a new, institutionally based, teleological normative framework. In doing so, it revises some familiar principles designed for application to kinetic wars, such as necessity and proportionality, and invokes some additional ones, such as reciprocity and trust. It goes on to explore the applications of this framework and a revised set of principles for national security intelligence institutions and practices in contemporary and emerging political and technological settings.

That process is fundamentally and irreducibly subjective, intrinsic to the human experience that is deeply embedded in analysis, and it takes place primarily within the medium of verbal language.

Unfolding the dry logic of uncertainty shows how intelligence failures caused by surprises are unavoidable.

Five conceptual categories of surprise are analyzed: lack of expectations; insufficient evidence between two or more alternative courses of action; false justified beliefs; incomplete theory to ground a belief, and an utterly false expectation produced by our (usually reliable) mindset.

The current study adopts a holistic view of the interaction between ‘informant’ and ‘handler’ to develop a bespoke informant interview model (RWITS-US: Review and Research, Welfare, Information, Tasking, Security, Understanding Context, Sharing). This model is compared to the PEACE model of interviewing as part of a novel experimental paradigm using mock-informants (N = 19), measuring levels of motivation, rapport, cooperation and intelligence gain. Results indicate that the RWITS-US model generated significantly greater levels of self-reported rapport without having any detrimental effect on the other measured variables.

Supported by 2022 research which surveyed New Zealand public perceptions of the NZIC and the tolerances of Effects Operations, we seek to establish, through an examination of Covert Action policy amongst Five Eyes partners and New Zealand intelligence literature, an understanding of a working definition of Effects Operations, and show that despite previous thinking linked to ethical challenges related to the conduct of such activity, the wider New Zealand public is likely to be supportive of some form of NZIC Effects Operations mandate in the service of national security policy goals.

In line with the recent attempts to integrate intelligence theory with philosophy, this article is intended to contribute to the philosophy of intelligence by defining a dedicated account of causation for it. The Unified Theory for Intelligence Analysis, as this account of causation is named, is intended to integrate into a single account Betts’ Normal and Exceptional Theories as well as Hendrickson’s target challenges. It is then proved that a pluralistic account of causation that combines both counterfactual and probabilistic accounts of causation is the most successful option.

The aim of this article is to examine military intelligence from a complexity science perspective and discuss related concepts such as sensemaking and reflexivity. For this, military and intelligence theory, doctrine, and practice are studied. Complexity insights from military sciences are used to review mental models and current thinking in military intelligence. Rather than viewing it as a clearly defined and autonomous field or function embodied by a closed intelligence cycle, military intelligence is best seen as a situated practice. This situatedness is illustrated in two cases regarding vertical and horizontal contextual influences. First, a discussion of North Atlantic Treaty Organization deployments in Afghanistan shows important vertical influences: the impact of (political) context and task. Second, a review of United Nations missions exemplifies the horizontal dimension: the need for informal collaboration, ad hoc organization, and a holistic approach. However, both cases show vertical and horizontal influences.

We know little about the behavior of intelligence and security services in the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. This article examines the Greek Intelligence Service (KYP) and, since 1986, the National Intelligence Service as its successor. A principal ingredient for the democratic embedment of the service was a break with this dictatorial past and, consequently, its demilitarization. This article shows that the de facto demilitarization of the service was a protracted process that was largely independent from the de jure formal demilitarization in 1986. It both preceded and lagged the legislative decision in 1986. This article particularly focusses on personnel policies aimed at distancing the service from its former ties to the junta regime (1967–1974), the “old KYP.” Its methodological contribution lies in its reliance on original, oral history interviews with former employees of the service and in its systematic analysis of newspaper publications for research on the KYP. I argue and show that internal organizational factors, most notably professionalization and shifting responsibilities, rather than external factors such as party politics or a prodemocratic ideological vision, are the key explanations for a change in the otherwise persistent military staffing of the intelligence service.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FXZQV58K,2023-11-02,Eleni Braat,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2023-11-07T23:23:58Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

Analyzing this event raises important questions about the nature and limitations of intelligence warning for private industry. Corporate security intelligence has been adopted by many companies that desire a ‘decision advantage’, but in this case, it failed to foresee the attack. A seminal report on the attack produced by Statoil (now Equinor) encouraged numerous changes in how companies should protect themselves against severe security threats. One conclusion was that in uncertain and dangerous environments, intelligence cannot be relied upon to reduce uncertainty and provide adequate warning. The Statoil report acknowledges that the joint venture likely would not have gotten the intelligence necessary to warn of an impending attack. The core business is not necessarily focused on the changing threat environment. In this case, even more accurate ‘tactical’ intelligence might not have led to a timely evacuation. Moreover, as the Algerian Army's failure to prevent the In Amenas attack reveals, corporations' risk assessments cannot ignore the severe limitations of their host country security institutions.

The just war tradition is put forward as an alternative framing of key ethical issues that can be translated into a practical code for intelligence officers that can be adapted to changing levels of threat in a way that is difficult to derive from a timeless philosophical analysis.,https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/WD92MKEQ,2023-10-20,David Omand,,Criminal Law and Philosophy,2023-10-24T07:39:55Z,['DVEM4H4W']
2217,Why the French military cryptanalysis failed to break Enigma,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/01611194.2023.2261121,"In July 1939, when the French military discovered the possibility of breaking Enigma thanks to revelations from the Polish Cipher Service, it came as a complete surprise. Although the French secret services had known about the German machine for almost ten years, the military cryptologists based in Paris had quickly concluded that it was impossible to break it. Only the forced exile of Polish mathematicians in France after the 1939 campaign enabled the French to decipher Enigma from January 1940 until the June defeat. While the story of the Polish and British cryptological successes is now well known through academic and mainstream literature, the French failure has received virtually no attention until now. Using unpublished archives held at the Defense Historical Service in Vincennes, this study analyzes the reasons for this fiasco and paints a picture of French military cryptanalysis in the 1930s, quite different from the past success of French codebreakers in the First World War.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/DMNSH68I,2023-10-19,Jean-Charles Foucrier,,Cryptologia,2023-10-24T07:39:37Z,"['T92JK7A5', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

Trust-building tactics that demonstrate trustworthiness and demonstrate a willingness to trust portray the interviewer as reliable and dependable (i.e., perceptions of cognitive trust) as well as convey goodwill and warmth (i.e., perceptions of affective trust) were viewed as likely to increase a source’s willingness to disclose critical information. Across three experiments, both tactics were found to be influential in engaging the reciprocity principle in a manner that elicited the sources’ cooperation and enhanced information yield. However, perceptions of cognitive trust were found to function as a direct encouragement to reveal information.

As MI6 secret agent A12, he evaded gunfire and shook off pursuers to break open the emerging Nazi conspiracy in 1919 Berlin. His reports, the first warning of the Nazi plot for WWII, went directly to the man known as C, the mysterious founder of MI6, and to prime ministers. But a powerful fascist politician quietly worked to suppress his alerts. Nevertheless, his intelligence sabotaged the Nazis in ways only now revealed. Bell became a spy once again in the face of WWII. In 1939, he was the first to crack Hitler’s deadliest secret code: the Holocaust. At that time, the führer was a popular politician who said he wanted peace. Could anyone believe Bell’s shocking warning?

However, while research into intelligence cultures is developing, it remains heavily focused on the US and UK. Meanwhile, although Israeli intelligence has received extensive attention through historical and practical perspectives, with studies focusing on analytical failures, counterterrorism, and covert operations, hitherto there has been no comprehensive study of it through a cultural lens. The thesis addresses this gap and offers a conceptualization (anatomy) of the Israeli national intelligence culture, by applying a strategic cultures framework and adopting a social constructivist research approach. It is based on 34 elite interviews with former and acting Israeli practitioners. The thesis finds that Israeli intelligence culture is distinctive in the way in which it rejects formal management of the intelligence system on the national level, preferring informal cooperation between agencies and pluralism of intelligence assessments. Intelligence in Israel is action-inclined and integrated in decision-making. It is also practice-inclined and has been averse to intelligence theories and scientific methods, preferring adaptation through bottom-up innovations. These characteristics reflect several sources: an Israeli strategic culture of exceptionalism arising from a sense of living under existential threats; a political culture of securitization; the historical origins of military intelligence dominance; and typical Israeli ‘chutzpah’. They also reflect lessons learned from two major traumas of Israeli intelligence: the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and the Second Lebanon War in 2006. The thesis argues that Israeli intelligence culture is not unitary in essence nor fixed in time. However, moral courage, contrarian thinking, individual responsibility, and a sense of national mission have persisted as its foundational professional values. They highlight the enduring status of intelligence as a core pillar of Israeli national security.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/S2LUI7PM,2023-09-27,Itai Shapira,,,2023-10-18T11:47:25Z,['CK5MNYPQ']

Still, intelligence professionals do not understand the insight process well enough to achieve consistently such indispensable outcomes. Little, if any, research has studied how intelligence analysts achieve insights. A qualitative, interview-based unclassified study was conducted to understand how insight emerges in 36 intelligence analysts who solved novel problems. The results include an emergence process consisting of two interacting elements—internalized tensions and priming—across the emotion–cognition and individual–social dimensions, and that the relationship between the two elements is complex. The emergence of insight is not predictable or controllable, which has significant challenges for the management of intelligence analysts because intelligence agencies typically are hierarchical organizations that emphasize order and control, conditions antithetical for nurturing emergence. This conundrum requires a major individual and cultural shift by management.

But also differences, with Russia being by far the main instigator of espionage in Europe, a strong concentration of cases in Northern Europe, and a diversity of legislation coinciding with equally variable outcomes in court.

We argue that whilst structural and institutional factors played a significant role in the creation of a mid-20th century Cambridge spy ring, the role and agency of individuals was paramount, and Oxford was missing comparable personalities. Specifically, the galvanising effect of an intellectual authority figure in the person of Cambridge Don Maurice Dobb, the greater attention, talent, and strategy by Soviet intelligence recruiter Arnold Deutsch, and the higher level of ideological commitment and social reinforcement on the part of the Cambridge Five themselves—as a ring—were of greater significance.

To this end, the empirical evidence of three prominent SATs is reviewed: empirical research provides support for brainstorming and devil’s advocacy. The analysis of competing hypotheses, however, does not have empirical support. Based on the literature review and conceptual criticism of SATs, implications are discussed: the Intelligence Community (IC) must discard its antiempiricism. To this end, intelligence studies programs should regularly incorporate quantitative research methods courses in their curricula. The research community, on the other hand, should seek more frequent collaboration with the IC, to support the IC in improving the empirical foundations of their work. This could improve judgmental processes in intelligence analysis as well—possibly both within and beyond SATs.

The letter indicated that Husayni and Arslan accepted Italian bribes in exchange for pro-Italian articles in the publications they controlled. Italy was widely despised for its treatment of Libyan Muslims, and so exposing this relationship was expected to be controversial. Amid a national debate about Italy’s imminent invasion of Abyssinia, and its role in the Eastern Mediterranean, Husayni’s Palestinian opponents hoped to embarrass him as a sell-out. Both a government official and national leader, Husayni’s true position came to define the Palestinian debate about the national interest: should Palestinians co-operate with one oppressive empire so as to free themselves from another? Relying on multilingual and multinational archival evidence, this article proves that the letter was indeed forged, but based on real intelligence gathered by Husayni’s Palestinian opponents who sought to damage his reputation. It also shows that British intelligence probably encouraged the forgery, hoping to expose and stem Italian propaganda activity. The scheme backfired and accelerated Italian interference in Palestine. It crystalised Husayni’s popularity, as Palestinians believed he could deliver national liberation. They did not care if Italy was involved. This episode shows that British assessments of ‘factional’ Palestinian politics reflected their shallow understanding of these conflicts.

We examine how John Starnes, Director General of the Security Service, went to considerable lengths to resist this effort to politicize his agency, and to warn the government of the potential scandal should FAN TAN become publicly known. We conclude that the FAN TAN affair leaves a number of serious questions to be answered such as: who actually originated the scheme, its legality as well as propriety, what intelligence was used or continued to be collected after the RCMP sought to end its involvement, and why the matter was ignored by the subsequent McDonald Commission that prompted the dissolution of the Security Service.1",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/JQTXCU59,2023-08-28,"Dennis G.

From the time the Fourth Bureau of the Central Investigation Department (CID) was founded, it was headed by veteran intelligence expert Xue Qiao, who collected and analyzed OSINT to produce intelligence estimates for Chinese political leaders. These intelligence estimates covered a host of global and regional topics crucial for Chinese foreign policy, including U.S. politics and foreign policy, decolonization movements in the Third World, and political and economic developments around the world. Available evidence shows that politics and ideology marred the quality of China's OSINT research. When Mao Zedong launched the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s, the CID's intelligence estimates were distorted to advance his radical political agenda. Later on, China's intelligence research came under attack during Mao's Cultural Revolution. Kang Sheng and other radicals attacked OSINT analysts as traitors, and the CID ceased to function in the late 1960s and 1970s. After Mao's death, the CID was revived, but its intelligence estimates no longer served the new Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping. Deng's personal tension with CID Director Luo Qingchang, who had criticized him during the Cultural Revolution, hindered the CID's estimates. This political schism in the post-Mao years contributed to the CID's dissolution in 1983.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/UHJR6KRG,2023-06-23,"Huajie Jiang, Kazushi Minami",,Journal of Cold War Studies,2023-07-01T07:14:59Z,"['LXMU5UXP', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Since the mid-1920s, the British and Italian empires had clashing strategic priorities, conflicting commercial interests, and diverging support for warring local leaders in Arabia. In an effort to limit competition, the British and Italians came to an agreement in early 1927 over their respective spheres of influence in Arabia. Many scholars have brushed over what has become known as the ‘Rome Understanding’ as largely ineffectual and having had little impact on the overall policy of the two empires. Far from being inconsequential, however, the Rome Understanding established a standard over the limits of empire in the Arabian Peninsula and gave rise to an information order in the region designed to enforce it. This article demonstrates that the British and Italians developed imperial intelligence networks as a tool designed to mediate competition and preserve cooperation under the Rome Understanding.

Examining several well-documented historical cases, she argues that intelligence is widely misunderstood, on the common assumption that it consists of only what intelligence institutions do. With this in mind, she concludes that the proper goal of a government in utilising intelligence should be ‘the orchestration of intelligence in light of the competitive moment’ – ‘orchestration’ being a two-way street where communications pass up and down the chain between decision-makers and intelligence professionals, whom she believes should be encouraged to express strong views.

This was a logical outgrowth of increasing anxieties about the intentions of the German Kaiser and the experience of the Anglo-Boer War, in which a numerically superior British army found itself in a protracted battle with local forces skilled in the art of guerrilla warfare. Espionage fiction by writers such as Rudyard Kipling, E. Phillips Oppenheim, Erskine Childers, William Le Queux, and John Buchan used the example of the Anglo-Boer War to draw attention to the deficiencies in imperial intelligence, the potential threats to the empire, and the role of civilian patriots in thwarting internal and external threats. Espionage fiction educated British readers to perceive a need for systematic intelligence gathering, which ran counter to the democratic nature to which the British aspired. The popularity of non-professional patriotic spies as protagonists of mass market fiction allowed for the development of a broad popular constituency in favor of greater government commitment to intelligence gathering. And while this popular enthusiasm was beneficial to the Tory Party, it was not driven solely by conservative politicians, but rather by populist pressure stemming from mass culture inspired by literary reflections on the Anglo-Boer War.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YJ22AG4Z,2023-08-08,Anton Fedyashin,,Intelligence and National Security,2023-08-08T21:38:30Z,['9YH9YSYQ']

2268,Classified and Secret: Understanding the Literature on Diversity in the Intelligence Sector,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1093/isr/viad033,"Intelligence services are important sites of contestation, often the foci of reform and calls for greater transparency. Yet, while growing attention has been paid to intersectionality, gender equality reform, and progress in other areas of international affairs, little of this same transparency and attention has been paid to diversity in the intelligence sector. This paper seeks to bridge the gap, comprising a systematic review of the literature on diversity in the intelligence sector to improve our understanding of what is known and what can be known about the history and current make-up of the intelligence sector—and those who “do intelligence work”. By identifying strengths and gaps in the literature and setting an agenda for future research within these “secret institutions”, this paper argues that the lack of transparency, data, and knowledge on the interplay of gender, race, and sexuality, among other aspects of diversity in intelligence, is deeply troubling. It hampers our knowledge of how the sector may be “gendered” or otherwise experienced, as well as how this particular area of the security sector may or may not be integrating gender and other perspectives into their work. This paper finds that diversity in the intelligence and national security sectors is both an asset and a liability to be managed. Diversity is seen as a source of intelligence gathering and analysis strength, as well as a potential threat to hegemonic masculinity in intelligence practice. Further, language and processes for promoting diversity in intelligence can reinforce stereotyped knowledge of marginalized groups that ultimately hamper calls for greater representation, diversity, inclusion, access, and opportunities in the intelligence sector.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/JRBJA6J7,2023-09-01,"Elise Stephenson, Susan Harris Rimmer",,International Studies Review,2023-08-07T09:15:23Z,['HCN8YFI8']

In addition to the human lives lost, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed serious national security concerns, notably for economic, societal, and in some cases, political stability. In response, a greater emphasis must be placed on intelligence. The paper has three goals. First, it outlines the major thematic areas where key ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence communities’ (ICs) skills were tested in supporting the management of COVID-19: 1) the origins of SARS-CoV-2, 2) disinformation campaigns, and 3) early warning systems. The article then explores how such factors have impacted ICs’ ability to provide decision-making support during COVID-19. Finally, the article discusses how ‘Five Eyes’ ICs may strengthen capacity in the three crucial areas.

Found guilty of directing an extensive agent network against Chinese political, economic and military intelligence targets, he remained in custody until his alleged suicide in 1970. Since then, Redmond’s life has been the subject of several Western publications, but detail has been scarce about his reporting requirements, collection methods and the security operation that culminated in his arrest. Drawing on Chinese accounts of the case, this paper addresses these gaps. A picture emerges of non-official cover arrangements flawed from the outset at a time when the US demand for Korean War-related intelligence was at its height. Alerted by doctrine and success against another local CIA operation, Shanghai’s security apparatus moved cautiously against Redmond’s network, obtaining evidence that made the guilty verdict of 1954 inevitable. To Chinese intelligence practitioners, the case provides an exemplary example of how counter-espionage work against the US should proceed in the 21st century. In July 2019, CIA would ‘neither confirm nor deny the existence or non-existence’ of records related to Redmond’s activities in China, and the 50th anniversary of his death in 2020 passed without public official acknowledgement.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/AC2VRJTG,2023-07-18,David Ian Chambers,,Journal of Intelligence History,2023-07-26T07:00:55Z,['CZT6L9T7']

Explicitly connects Chile and the transatlantic origins of the whole Cold War to subsequent Chilean history from the late-1940s into the 1970s
Acknowledges the importance and pertinence of intra-Latin American relations, particularly Chileans' relations with their neighbours
Reconstructs Chile's early nuclear history and folds it into the larger whole of the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace proposal and the IAEA's subsequent history, further mapping the emergence of the global nuclear landscape
Find out more: listen to an interview with James Lockhart on the Scholars Strategy Network podcast
James Lockhart blends Chilean, inter-American and transatlantic national, regional and world-historical trends into a century-long Cold War narrative. He argues that Chileans made their own history as highly engaged internationalists while reassessing American and other foreign-directed intelligence, surveillance and secret warfare operations in Chile and southern South America.

The book transcends a well-known, US-centred historiography while offering a more equitable and global interpretation of Chile's Cold War experience than previously possible. This advances research that has progressively expanded the framework of Chile's Cold War experience since the arrest of General Augusto Pinochet in the UK for human rights violations more than 20 years ago.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/UKRBEM2F,2019-02-01,James Lockhart,Edinburgh University Press,,2023-07-18T06:17:47Z,['CZT6L9T7']

However, the impact on police intelligence remains an unexplored area. Understanding how the pandemic affected the volume of police intelligence is important as it underpins the intelligence-led policing model, which is as a key system that helps drive police activity. In this study, data from 20 police services over a 4-year period that outlines the annual volume of intelligence reports retained by services is analysed using inferential statistics to establish that during 2020 there was a significant rise in intelligence held by the police. In this study, several hypothesis are considered as causal factors that contributed to the rises and conclude that the pandemic is the most likely reason, which is caused by a rise in public order intelligence related to breaches of coronavirus legislation. The impact on the division of labour that arises from tasking such police intelligence is discussed, and the article calls upon similar research on the issuance of coronavirus fixed penalties and stop and search activity during the pandemic, to suggest that the rises have the potential to contribute to the disproportionate targeting of black and minority ethnic communities.

Objective: This paper aimed to demonstrate the value of open-source intelligence in Ukraine to identify signals of potential radiological events of health significance during the Ukrainian conflict.
Methods: Data were collected from search terminology for radiobiological events and acute radiation syndrome detection between February 1 and March 20, 2022, using 2 open-source intelligence (OSINT) systems, EPIWATCH and Epitweetr.
Results: Both EPIWATCH and Epitweetr identified signals of potential radiobiological events throughout Ukraine, particularly on March 4 in Kyiv, Bucha, and Chernobyl.

This article explores and compares the 2016 Holey Artisan (Bangladesh) and the 2019 Easter (Sri Lanka) attacks from intelligence failure perspectives to understand the fault lines in counterterrorism (CT) efforts in the south Asian context. The article summarises the causes of intelligence failures into three broad yet interconnected themes: failure due to issues within the intelligence activities and agencies, failure leading from policy or direction, and failure arising from psychological forces. This article concludes that poorly coordinated counterterrorism policy, poor internal security and border management apparatus and cognitive limits of the security forces were the causes of the intelligence failure in the Holey Artisan attack. On the other hand, the intelligence failure of the Easter Sunday attacks resulted from political leadership, miscommunication and psychological limits of top intelligence officials, and the intelligence community’s failure to adapt to the emerging security threat of Islamist extremism.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/95GZYKI4,2023-06-26,Masrur Mahmud Khan,,"Journal of Policing, Intelligence and Counter Terrorism",2023-06-30T07:42:03Z,"['D7XFV7JL', 'TLFN4NAL']"

This can confront agencies with a dilemma wherein they are pressed to demonstrate the rationale for a covert mission in ways that undermine future operational security. Evidence from the strikes on Osama bin Laden and Iran’s General Soleimani will be used to argue that retrospective briefs designed to enhance legitimacy or prestige are problematic.

2301,‘Long Cold War’? Intelligence and the precarious Anglo-Soviet wartime alliance,Thesis,https://hdl.handle.net/1880/116605,"During the interwar period (1919-1939), British politicians were unwilling to treat the revolutionary Soviet state as a serious factor in European politics. From the British side, the relationship was marked by frustration, mistrust, and animosity. This was an early, ideologically-driven Cold War. As Europe’s clouds darkened in the 1930s and a new war seemed increasingly possible, a British-Soviet partnership was a possibility, but both opted to deal instead with Adolf Hitler in the desperate hopes of avoiding war. Hitler would eventually bring Britain and the USSR together when he launched Barbarossa in June 1941. The Second World War forced the Anglo-Soviet relationship to change. Once the USSR survived the German attack, it became increasingly clear the Red Army would destroy Nazi Germany and dominate the European political picture. Although the wartime Anglo-Soviet partnership, embodied in the ‘Grand Alliance’ that included the United States, was often on shaky ground, Britain, knowing it needed the USSR after the war, sought to determine if it would be a cooperative or hostile power. This process, begun in 1943, used a new source of intelligence: intercepted diplomatic communications from various European capitals. Diplomats closely watched the Grand Alliance both as a war-fighting entity, and that which would determine the peace settlement after victory. These well-positioned and perceptive diplomats understood the European political map faced an upheaval, and they sought to assess the danger presented by the USSR. Their observations offered British politicians valuable insight into Soviet intentions, which, increasingly, portended a confrontational postwar relationship as Moscow, relentlessly pursuing the security of its borders, sought to expand its influence into states like Poland and Turkey. These communications have been little used by historians, and never for the purpose of contextualizing how British leaders grappled with their position as a power in eclipse, their relationship with the ascendant United States, and whether the USSR would support or subvert a postwar settlement.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6TLMDDJ5,2023-06-01,Patrick Michael Beckloff Cabel,,,2023-06-10T20:22:15Z,['SCCGXHMZ']

Not only does this volume explore Alexander’s rich military history, but also it provides a robust exploration of the 21st century security environment. Theorists and policymakers will gain insight into how Alexander’s story informs our thinking about peace, war, and strategy, while practitioners and educators will encounter ways to improve their approaches to leader development and building curricula. Ferguson and Worthington set forth these lessons in a thematic framework that organises Alexander’s reign into distinct parts, concluding these with a chapter that brings his lessons into the modern world. 25th National Security Advisor to the president of the United States, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, provides a thoughtful conclusion to this fascinating volume. Alexander’s timeless campaigns remain as germane to this age as any other and demonstrate the critical importance of dynamic leadership and historical studies in an era increasingly dominated by the culture of technology.
The Military Legacy of Alexander the Great is expertly written for students and scholars in a variety of disciplines, including Classics, Ancient History, Modern History, Peace Studies, and Military Studies. It is also of great interest to senior defence leaders, military academies, leadership- and management-focused academic programmes, intelligence organizations, and senior service colleges.

2318,A Contingency Approach to Public Sector Performance Management: The Case of the Canadian Intelligence Community,Thesis,http://ruor.uottawa.ca/handle/10393/44961,"Countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development have experienced a decline in citizens' trust in government in the last few decades. In response, public administration shifted from traditional public administration to New Public Management (NPM) with the goal of increasing trust in government by trying to make government more responsive, work better, and cost less. An important element of NPM is the reliance on managerialism's application of private sector solutions such as performance management whose assumed strength is that it can deliver on efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. An underlining basis of private sector imports into the public sector environment is that they are based on universalism – the existence of general laws irrespective of the situation or circumstance. Often, referred to as a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. However, after a few decades of implementing performance management based on universalistic principles the evidence suggests that performance management has not fully met expectations. Contrasting universalism is particularism - meaning that different rules and applications will depend on the situation, in other words, context matters. In short, 'no best way'. To explore the universalism vs particularism debate, this research uses the Management Accountability Framework (MAF) which is a Canadian government's long-standing performance management tool. The MAF serves as a proxy for a one-size-fits-all approach to performance management. With regards to particularism, this research employs a contingency approach as the theoretical basis to explore performance management. The contingency approach is premised on three core concepts: external contingent factors, internal contingent factors, and fit. The Canadian Intelligence Community (IC) is used as the case study to explore the primary question of whether a universalism-based or a particularism-based approach is better suited for performance management in the public sector? In seeking an answer to this question, two additional sub-questions are explored. First, what makes the IC different from the other policy domains? Second, what is the fit between the MAF and the IC's contingent factors? To answer these questions, data collection consisted of content analysis of documents as well as interviews with senior officials. Findings from this exploratory study reveal that universalism-based approaches to performance management should at the very least be complemented by particularism considerations. The IC was found to be different from other policy domains in terms of both external and internal contingent factors. The former consists of the threat environment, the legislative framework, and the external expectations of the IC. The latter consists of the intelligence process, the intelligence product, intelligence and secrecy, and the IC as a high reliability organization. It was found that there was more misfit than fit between the MAF and the IC's contingency factors. In exploring these questions, this research contributes concurrently to the public administration and intelligence studies literature in a number of ways. For instance, evidence that universalism-based approach to performance management does not always deliver what it promises, being able to intersect intelligence studies and public administration which is currently lacking, examining the 'hidden' parts of the public sector (i.e., the IC) that tends to be ignored in public administration, peering into the 'black box' of public sector organizations' management tools, the exploration of how practitioners use management tools, analyzing public sector organizations operating in a complex environment, adding to a limited non-historical contemporary Canadian IC literature, looking at the IC's performance-related issues that goes beyond the overwhelming intelligence failure literature. In addition to contributing to knowledge, the research highlights the importance of performance management and intelligence in relation to society.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/92U42SUD,2023-05-17,Giuseppe Faragone,,,2023-05-29T23:11:21Z,"['CK5MNYPQ', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

This negligence stems partly from its unclear definition and the difficult differentiation between “civilian” and “military” intelligence. The available official definitions serve instrumental purposes rather than compelling lines of reasoning and reflect the complex and heterogeneous structure of national military intelligence architectures. By using classical intelligence studies approaches, it is possible to get a better understanding of the various ways in which military intelligence can be defined. But such an approach must be complemented by an appreciation of five classic points of “bureaucratic contention” that influence how states define the role of military intelligence within their wider Intelligence Community.

In contrast, the Swedish government did not send its resident Anders Svensson to the Danish capital but to the city of Elsinore, as toll commissioner for the Sound, which played a decisive geostrategic role. Both residents were primarily tasked with acquiring relevant military information, and both sides also tried to build up a network of informants to obtain secret information. Interestingly, both governments commented on and criticized the dispatches of their diplomatic guests, thus making it clear that they were able to intercept the letters before letting them through to the actual addressees, that is, the hostile neighboring court.

2332,Spies: The Epic Intelligence War Between East and West,Book,https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Spies/Calder-Walton/9781668000694,"The riveting, secret story of the hundred-year intelligence war between Russia and the West with lessons for our new superpower conflict with China.

Spies is the history of the secret war that Russia and the West have been waging for a century. Espionage, sabotage, and subversion were the Kremlin’s means to equalize the imbalance of resources between the East and West before, during, and after the Cold War. There was nothing “unprecedented” about Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. It was simply business as usual, new means used for old ends.

The Cold War started long before 1945. But the West fought back after World War II, mounting its own shadow war, using disinformation, vast intelligence networks, and new technologies against the Soviet Union. Spies is an inspiring, engrossing story of the best and worst of mankind: bravery and honor, treachery and betrayal. The narrative shifts across continents and decades, from the freezing streets of St. Petersburg in 1917 to the bloody beaches of Normandy; from coups in faraway lands to present-day Moscow where troll farms, synthetic bots, and weaponized cyber-attacks being launched on the woefully unprepared West. It is about the rise and fall of eastern superpowers: Russia’s past and present and the global ascendance of China.

Mining hitherto secret archives in multiple languages, Calder Walton shows that the Cold War started earlier than commonly assumed, that it continued even after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, and that Britain and America’s clandestine struggle with the Soviet government provides key lessons for countering China today. This fresh reading of history, combined with practical takeaways for our current great power struggles, make Spies a unique and essential addition to the history of the Cold War and the unrolling conflict between the United States and China that will dominate the 21st century.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/MKS5UFVQ,2023-06-06,Calder Walton,Simon & Schuster,,2023-05-13T08:33:05Z,"['CZT6L9T7', 'SCCGXHMZ', 'WHBCJ8GW']"

The recent highly-publicized breaches of internet-based clandestine communications technology and targeted malware attacks, in combination with increasingly sophisticated methods for surveillance of internet traffic has arguably resulted in a cyber-denied environment. This paper employs a red-teaming approach to explore how clandestine communications can be structured using platforms that are physically separated from the internet and thus not vulnerable to internet-based surveillance or attacks. Recent developments in computer-based radio software can be combined with legacy radio technology to provide robust solutions for clandestine communications in a cyber-denied environment. Drawing on case studies from the Cold War, contemporary observations of clandestine radio networks in use today, and technical tests carried out by the authors, this paper stresses the importance for counterintelligence and law enforcement to be prepared for a potential shift in how clandestine communications are implemented by both hostile intelligence services and organized crime. Finally, the paper addresses the issue of proactively countering these techniques by presenting concrete methods for use by counterintelligence and law enforcement to detect radio-based clandestine communications and secure evidence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/T4FJBNXC,2023-05-12,"Tony Ingesson, Magnus Andersson",,"Journal of Policing, Intelligence and Counter Terrorism",2023-05-13T08:21:36Z,['8XXD789V']

Unfortunately, some within the military remit perceive information maneuver as the “2.0 version” of existing intelligence capabilities emphasizing the digitization of the battlefield. While enhanced intelligence, understanding, and decisionmaking are essential, information maneuver is, above all, a means to act and generate effects in the cognitive, virtual, or physical dimension similar to deception, propaganda, or covert actions.

Some 'sudden impact' events, such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters, blow up out of a clear blue sky. Other 'slow burn' crises smoulder away for years, often with warning signs ignored along the way until, as if from nowhere, the troops storm the palace.

In How to Survive a Crisis, Professor Sir David Omand draws on his experience in defence, security and intelligence, including as Director of GCHQ and UK Security and Intelligence Coordinator, to show how you can detect a looming crisis and extinguish it (or at least survive it with minimum loss).

Using gripping real-world examples from Omand's storied career, and drawing lessons from historic catastrophes such as Chernobyl, 9/11, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the WannaCry ransomware cyberattack, this empowering book is filled with practical advice on how to survive the multiplying crises of the future. Not every crisis need tip into disaster - if we have invested in personal, business and national resilience.

Center 16 of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) for long-term intelligence collection on sensitive
targets. To conduct operations using this tool, the FSB created a covert peer-to-peer (P2P) network of
numerous Snake-infected computers worldwide. Many systems in this P2P network serve as relay
nodes which route disguised operational traffic to and from Snake implants on the FSB’s ultimate
targets. Snake’s custom communications protocols employ encryption and fragmentation for
confidentiality and are designed to hamper detection and collection efforts.
We have identified Snake infrastructure in over 50 countries across North America, South America,
Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, to include the United States and Russia itself. Although Snake
uses infrastructure across all industries, its targeting is purposeful and tactical in nature. Globally, the
FSB has used Snake to collect sensitive intelligence from high-priority targets, such as government
networks, research facilities, and journalists. As one example, FSB actors used Snake to access and
exfiltrate sensitive international relations documents, as well as other diplomatic communications,
from a victim in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) country. Within the United States, the
FSB has victimized industries including education, small businesses, and media organizations, as
well as critical infrastructure sectors including government facilities, financial services, critical
manufacturing, and communications.
This Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides background on Snake’s attribution to the FSB and
detailed technical descriptions of the implant’s host architecture and network communications. This
CSA also addresses a recent Snake variant that has not yet been widely disclosed. The technical
information and mitigation recommendations in this CSA are provided to assist network defenders in
detecting Snake and associated activity. For more information on FSB and Russian state-sponsored
cyber activity, please see the joint advisory Russian State-Sponsored and Criminal Cyber Threats to

2344,Intelligence and the State: Analysts and Decision Makers,Book,https://www.usni.org/press/books/intelligence-and-state,"In the eighty years since Pearl Harbor, the United States has developed a professional intelligence community that is far more effective than most people acknowledge—in part because only intelligence failures see the light of day, while successful collection and analysis remain secret for decades. Intelligence and the State explores the relationship between the community tasked to research and assess intelligence and the national decision makers it serves. The book argues that in order to accept intelligence as a profession, it must be viewed as a non-partisan resource to assist key players in understanding foreign societies and leaders. Those who review these classified findings are sometimes so invested in their preferred policy outcomes that they refuse to accept information that conflicts with preconceived notions. Rather than demanding that intelligence evaluations conform to administration policies, a wise executive should welcome a source of information that has not “drunk the Kool-Aid” by supporting a specific policy decision. Jonathan M. House offers a brief overview of the nature of national intelligence, and especially of the potential for misperception and misunderstanding on the part of executives and analysts. Furthermore, House examines the rise of intelligence organizations first in Europe and then in the United States. In those regions fear of domestic subversion and radicalism drove the need for foreign surveillance. This perception of a domestic threat tempted policy makers and intelligence officers alike to engage in covert action and other policy-based, partisan activities that colored their understanding of their adversaries. Such biases go far to explain the inability of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to predict and deal effectively with their opponents.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9BERJ2HE,2022-04-15,Jonathan M.

The former Securitate was one of the most repressive intelligence services in the communist bloc and drastic reform was necessary in order to establish an efficient and trusted domestic intelligence service. Previous research by Bruneau and Matei highlighted the important steps that Romania has undertaken over the past years and argued that an efficient and robust oversight system has been built. This article addresses contemporary debates on factors triggering reform in parliamentary intelligence and focuses on Romania’s 2017 reforms. These reforms can be analyzed through the application of the “fire alarm/police patrol” model developed by Loch K. Johnson for changes in congressional oversight. By increasing and clarifying the power of the Joint Standing Committee for the Oversight of the Romanian Intelligence Service, the 2017 changes brought more clarity and more accountability to the oversight system.

Twice daily, the Detachment provided intelligence to the USS Buchanan (DDG-14), US Navy SEALS, and Special Forces units including tactical and strategic forecasts of enemy movements, information that was otherwise unavailable to U.S. units and advisors in-country.

In the weeks before the offensive, vital agent reports and verbal warnings by the 571st MI Detachment had been ignored by all the major commands; they were only heeded, and then only very reluctantly, once the Offensive began. This refusal to listen to the intelligence explains why no Army or USMC organizations were on-call to recover prisoners discovered or U.S. personnel downed behind enemy lines, as in the BAT-21 incident, as the last two Combat Recon Platoons in Vietnam had been disbanded six weeks before the offensive began. The lessons and experiences of Operation Lam Son 719 in the previous year were ignored, especially with regard to the NVA’s tactical use of tanks and artillery.

The rationale behind these objectives is similar to other types of warfare, as cyberwarfare is both a dimension of actual warfare and stand-alone war area. In this chapter, cyberwarfare and related phenomena will be extensively discussed.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XYKC753M,May 2023,"Caner Asbaş, Şule Erdem Tuzlukaya",IGI Global,,2023-02-14T07:20:48Z,['8XXD789V']

seminar Intelligence Analysis Workshop in Department of Political Science and the International
Studies Program at Virginia Tech. In January 2023 students were given instructions to begin
developing intelligence analysis products using open-source materials on topics pertaining to the
war in Ukraine. Students could choose any relevant topic and present an abstract to the class. If
their topic was deemed sufficient, they were then given approval to begin research. For the first
half of the semester the students were given detailed instruction on how to write intelligence
analysis products including how to address different forms of bias. Concurrently students were
given instruction on how to collect various types of OSINT and how to remain secure while doing
so. Each student was taught how to maintain their cybersecurity and how to protect their identity
in online spaces. During the second half of the semester students read numerous declassified
intelligence analysis products from various agencies within the United States Intelligence
Community and OSINT products from various organizations. The students regularly met with me
as the instructor of record and received feedback and additional source materials. Each of the
students turned in a complete draft of their report prior to this final copy. Inclusion in this final
report was voluntary. All inclusions also had to be approved by a panel editors elected by members
of the class. This report contains no names, titles, or affiliations of the authors. By decision and to
protect the future employment prospects of the students all reports are anonymous. If you wish to
receive further information on one of the reports, you may reach out to the Tech4Humanity Lab
directly. The work below is not perfect and surely contains errors missed by both me as the faculty
member and the editorial team. It is the culmination of a semester’s worth of learning and work

Due to the circumstances of the conflict, derived not only from the failure of a coup but also from a “balance of disabilities” of one power to impose itself on another, the systematization of information did not appear as a necessity in the rebel army until the end of the frontal military frontal assault on Madrid and its transformation into a long war moving in a northerly direction.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/RHNIY7ME,2023-06-23,Gutmaro Gómez Bravo,Routledge,,2023-05-06T08:54:16Z,['MP7FJ9UA']

An ill-informed army risked blundering unexpectedly into the enemy or being taken by surprise. Basic reason would have told commanders this much, even without Vegetius's maxims to remind them: ‘In war, the one who is more vigilant in the field, the one who works harder training soldiers, will be less subject to danger’. Likewise, a commander who was able to conceal his movements and intentions was more likely to operate freely and to be able to surprise his enemy: ‘No plans are better than those you carry out while the enemy is unaware of them’. All of which was easier said than done, especially in an age before dedicated military colleges, precise maps or specialist intelligence services. Nevertheless, the very fact that medieval armies assembled and campaigned effectively indicates that they were capable of a certain level of intelligence gathering. Chronicles contain a number of hints about how this might have been achieved and more than a few stories about cunning spies.Misdirection: Achieving the ‘Mastery of Space and Time’Carl von Clausewtiz, Prussian general and seminal military theorist, defined military strategy as follows:Strategy decides the time when, the place where, and the forces with which the engagement is to be fought, and through this threefold activity exerts considerable influence on its outcome. Once the tactical encounter has taken place and the result – be it victory or defeat – is assured, strategy will use it to serve the object of the war.This was also true for medieval warfare. Verbruggen has demonstrated that medieval campaigns were conducted according to sound strategic principles: the maintenance of collective morale, coordinating and concentrating one's forces, attempting to attack with superior numbers and the element of surprise and, when necessary, seeking a decisive engagement with the enemy force. Surprise is particularly relevant for this study, as it usually necessary to deceive the person you wish to surprise: if somebody is aware of your intentions and actions, they cannot be surprised by what you do.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/LLUD7ENH,2022-07-05,James Titterton,Boydell & Brewer,,2023-05-05T08:08:01Z,['DS3WDJUS']

Collection is one of these stages and is characterized by the application of a set of disciplines to obtain information that will be analyzed for the production of an intelligence product. These disciplines are characterized according to the type of source, its methods and techniques. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the collection discipline focused on publicly available information. Open-source collection methods are usually represented by working diagrams that draw a flow according to the type of information.

The process of getting the IRA to end its so-called 'armed struggle' was always the prerequisite of the search for peace. It was Operation Chiffon that finally helped make it possible.

Operation Chiffon takes us inside the top-secret intelligence operation whose roots go back to the bloodiest years of the conflict in the early 1970s, involving officers from MI6 and, later in the 1990s, MI5. The remarkable story, which has remained hidden for forty years, is now revealed by legendary BBC journalist Peter Taylor with unique access to the officers involved. Drawing on exclusive interviews and Taylor's fifty years of covering the conflict, the book narrates in first-hand detail how those involved risked their careers – and their lives – to help secure the fragile peace that exists today.

Taylor vividly brings this covert operation to life and in the process chronicles the history of Sinn Féin, rising from obscurity in the early days of the Troubles to becoming the largest political party in Ireland today. It is a story fraught with uncertainty and danger that, as Brexit risks destabilising what was achieved in the Good Friday Agreement twenty-five years ago, is more important than ever to remember.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/MGMLXWCB,2023-03-30,Peter Taylor,Bloomsbury,,2023-05-03T07:57:22Z,['V7KUA58M']
2372,World War I and the Foundations of American Intelligence,Book,https://kansaspress.ku.edu/9780700635856,"Ask an American intelligence officer to tell you when the country started doing modern intelligence and you will probably hear something about the Office of Strategic Services in World War II or the National Security Act of 1947 and the formation of the Central Intelligence Agency. What you almost certainly will not hear is anything about World War I. In World War I and the Foundations of American Intelligence, Mark Stout establishes that, in fact, World War I led to the realization that intelligence was indispensable in both wartime and peacetime.

After a lengthy gestation that started in the late nineteenth century, modern American intelligence emerged during World War I, laying the foundations for the establishment of a self-conscious profession of intelligence. Virtually everything that followed was maturation, reorganization, reinvigoration, or reinvention. World War I ushered in a period of rapid changes. Never again would the War Department be without an intelligence component. Never again would a senior American commander lead a force to war without intelligence personnel on their staff. Never again would the United States government be without a signals intelligence agency or aerial reconnaissance capability.

Stout examines the breadth of American intelligence in the war, not just in France, not just at home, but around the world and across the army, navy, and State Department, and demonstrates how these far-flung efforts endured after the Armistice in 1918. For the first time, there came to be a group of intelligence practitioners who viewed themselves as different from other soldiers, sailors, and diplomats. Upon entering World War II, the United States had a solid foundation from which to expand to meet the needs of another global hot war and the Cold War that followed.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PDTTRLTC,2023-11-16,Mark Stout,University Press of Kansas,,2023-04-29T01:00:08Z,['BNPYHVD4']

2376,The Commander’s Eyes and Ears: Australian Army Combat Intelligence in the Cold War (1945-75),Thesis,http://hdl.handle.net/1959.4/101141,"Between 1945 and 1975, the Australian Army was committed to various operations ranging from supporting war crimes trials, occupation duties in Japan, and WWI-like warfare in Korea to counterinsurgency deployments in Malaya, Borneo, and South Vietnam. While official historians, respected academics, and popular authors cover these operations well, the role of the army’s combat intelligence during this period has been seriously neglected. Consequently, the paucity of serious research on the army’s intelligence during the Cold War means that numerous gaps remain in our understanding of how it operated and supported force commanders on operations. This thesis corrects this deficiency by defining and evaluating the Australian Army’s combat intelligence contribution during the Cold War in the 1945-75 period. Using official archival records and new individual evidence from veterans, much of which had not been publicly available before, and some that were not accessible by the official historians, it explores the organisation, administration, training, doctrine, and effectiveness of army combat intelligence operations. It also examines their ability to adapt to the changes in warfare and technology after the Second World War. Several myths, criticisms, and misremembered ‘facts’ that have grown around the Australian Army’s intelligence operations in the post-war period are explored, and the record corrected regarding several inaccuracies in our official history. While small compared to the US or the British Army’s contribution of battlefield intelligence resources during the Cold War, the Australian Army’s support was both meaningful and significant. It was meaningful because it helped establish the post-war Australian Intelligence Corps' professional foundation and was significant as it provided essential support to Australian and allied commanders on operations in Japan, Korea, Malaya, Borneo, and Vietnam.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XWSZKELV,2023,Glenn Wahlert,,,2023-04-21T23:21:12Z,"['CZT6L9T7', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

In this volume, the author deals with the origins of the KGB from the Tsarist Okhrana (the first Russians secret political police) to the OGPU, Joint State Political Directorate, one of the KGB predecessors between 1923 and 1934. Based on documents from the Russian archives, the author clearly demonstrates that the Cheka and GPU/OPGU were initially created to defend the revolution and not for espionage.

The Okhrana operated in both the Russian Empire and abroad against the revolutionaries and most of its operations, presented in this book, are little known. The same is the case with regards to the period after the Cheka was established in December 1917 until ten years later when Trotsky was expelled from the Communist Party and exiled, and Stalin rose to power. For the long period after the Revolution and up to the Second World War (and, indeed, beyond until the death of Stalin) the Cheka’s main weapon was terror to create a general climate of fear in a population.

In the book, the work of the Cheka and its successors against the enemies of the revolution is paralleled with British and American operations against the Soviets inside and outside of Russia. For the first time the creation of the Communist International (Comintern) is shown as an alternative Soviet espionage organization for wide-scale foreign propaganda and subversion operations based on the new revelations from the Soviet archives
Here, the early Soviet intelligence operations in several countries are presented and analysed for the first time, as are raids on the Soviet missions abroad. The Bolshevik smuggling of the Russian imperial treasures is shown based on the latest available archival sources with misinterpretations and sometimes false interpretations in existing literature revised.

After the Bolshevik revolution, Mansfield Smith-Cumming, the first chief of SIS, undertook to set up ‘an entirely new Secret Service organization in Russia’. During those first ten years, events would develop as a non-stop struggle between British intelligence, within Russia and abroad, and the Cheka, later GPU/OGPU.

Before several show ‘spy trials’ in 1927, British intelligence networks successfully operated in Russia later moving to the Baltic capitals, Finland and Sweden while young Soviet intelligence officers moved to London, Paris, Berlin and Constantinople. Many of those operations, from both sides, are presented in the book for the first time in this ground-breaking study of the dark world of the KGB.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/2RW9M3UM,2023-04-30,Boris Volodarsky,Pen and Sword,,2023-04-20T02:53:30Z,['CZT6L9T7']

Opportunities for the collection of foreign intelligence exist within the United States. Two narratives regarding foreign intelligence collection run through the primary source record of Bureau history. The first narrative is that foreign intelligence information is a byproduct of the Bureau’s reactive investigations of threats to national security and the second is that the Bureau has exploited opportunities to develop foreign intelligence as a distinct objective. This latter narrative is supported by a lengthy legacy of activities directed at gathering foreign intelligence and at facilitating the collection of foreign intelligence by other agencies.

It is a single-site explorative case study of the Middle Eastern analytic department using multiple sources in the form of formal descriptions, organograms, and qualitative interviews with intelligence and government officials to explore and compare the manifest and assumed organization. The study concludes that the cycle is merely a metaphor for a New Public Management framework in use in the Danish Defence Intelligence Service and across the Danish central administration.

Intelligence agencies are among the first victims of state capture and among the major instruments in further capturing state institutions. This process has been a product of the agreed transition from autocracy to democracy that prevented bloodshed but maintained a clientelist relationship between (new) democratic leadership and the (old) security apparatus. Consequently, thorough intelligence reform never happened, resulting in the survival of agencies’ strongholds of power, which facilitated the return to old secret police practice. It is not uncommon today that among important tasks of security intelligence are regime protection through suppression of political opposition and critical voices, as well as making sure that suspicious deals of those close to the ruling party run smoothly.

Building on the concept of coercive isomorphism, this article argues that intelligence support for common security and defense policy activities has been limited and contentious because of the vulnerability gap caused by patterns enforced by member states. Priority for national interests and assets hinders the logic of reciprocity. It lowers the value of synergetic links between the intelligence services of member states and relevant EU agencies and bodies.

The event was recorded as an “aggressive, hostile countersurveillance effort,” but with the U.S. victory in the Cold War, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and the dismantlement of the State Committee for Security, the investigative record was inconclusively filed away before the applicable lessons could be captured. After 30+ years, the declassified details of the investigation and the sequence of events leading to this fateful Munich night is examined under an inductive causal analysis to deconstruct the events using a case study methodology. After a comprehensive analysis, it becomes evident that the engagement was mischaracterized, and the hostile operation had much broader implications. While the hostile engagement was a black swan event, the sequence of events in the investigation leading to this final act was a microcosm of the larger Soviet strategic disinformation, misdirection, and manipulation apparatus. Three decades after fading into obscurity under a veil of classification restrictions, counterintelligence professionals, intelligence analysts, and intelligence historians can now benefit from the still-relevant lessons and other insights from this case study.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/RR2BYE8J,2023-04-12,Aden C.

But little has been written about the men and units employed when something more subtle than the march of legions into pitched battle was required. This is the only book available dedicated to Roman special ops and the role of the Speculatores, Exploratores, Protectores and Areani.

Simon Elliott reveals the kinds of special operations conducted by the Romans: tactical scouting ahead of the legions, covert strategic reconnaissance in neighbouring states, espionage, assassination or abduction of dissidents and enemies, counter-insurgency, and close protection of Roman officials and commanders. While such missions were frequently executed by ad-hoc units or individuals detailed for that specific mission, the author goes on to reveal the evidence for the aforementioned specialist units. He concludes with an analysis of the extent to which these various forces corresponded to a modern conception of Special Forces.

The entanglement between flying pigeons for “sport” and capturing pigeons for “espionage” is critical to construe multiple meanings of more-than-human border intrusion in South Asia. Such an incursion not only endangers long-standing values of human-pigeon companionship but also moots a perplexity of intrusion that lies between the ethical acceptance of the more-than-human intruders and necessary resistance to their hostile infiltration.

As the security and policy-making environment becomes increasingly complicated for decision-makers, the focus on intelligence agencies ‘to deliver’ more value will increase. This book is the first extensive exploration of contemporary leadership in the context of intelligence agencies, principally in the ‘Five Eyes’ nations (i.e. Australia, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and New Zealand). It provides a grounded theoretical approach to building practitioner and researcher understanding of what individual and organisational factors result in better leadership. Using interviews from former senior intelligence leaders and a survey of 208 current and former intelligence leaders, the work explores the key challenges that leaders will likely face in the twenty-first century and how to address these. It also explores what principles are most likely to be important in developing future leaders of intelligence agencies in the future.

Consequently, Muḥammad trusted only his inner circle, which continuously provided him with intelligence. He himself hence simultaneously assumed the role of chief of intelligence and counterintelligence, as he wanted to keep his networks, motivations, plans and manoeuvres secret.

Britain was confronted by the bombs and bullets of militant republicans, the clandestine intrigues of foreign powers and the strategic dangers of Ireland's wartime neutrality - a final, irrevocable step in the country's difficult transition to independence. Using newly-opened archives, this book reveals for the first time how the British intelligence system responded to these threats. It lifts the lid on the underground activities of Britain's secret agencies - MI5, MI6/SIS and the Special Branch. It puts secret intelligence in the context of the government's other sources of information and explores how deep-rooted cultural stereotypes distorted intelligence and shaped perceptions. And it shows how, for decades, British intelligence struggled to cope with Ireland but then rose to the challenge after 1940, largely because the Dublin government began to share its secrets. The author casts light on characters long kept in the shadows - IRA gunrunners, Bolshevik agitators, Nazi agents, Irish loyalists who acted as British spies.

The first modernist building in Britain to use reinforced concrete and architecture, its construction demanded new building techniques. But the building was as remarkable for those who took up residence there as for the application of revolutionary building techniques. There were 32 Flats in all, and they became a haunt of some of the most prominent Soviet agents working against Britain in the 1930s and 40s, among them Arnold Deutsch, the controller of the group of Cambridge spies who came to be known as the &quot;Magnificent Five&quot; after the Western movie The Magnificent Seven; the photographer Edith Tudor-Hart; and Melita Norwood, the longest-serving Soviet spy in British espionage history. However, it wasn't only spies who were attracted to the Lawn Road Flats, the Bauhaus exiles Walter Gropius, László Moholy-Nagy and Marcel Breuer; the pre-historian Gordon Vere Childe; and the poet (and Bletchley Park intelligence officer) Charles Brasch all made their way there. A number of British artists, sculptors and writers were also drawn to the Flats, among them the sculptor and painter Henry Moore; the novelist Nicholas Monsarrat; and the crime writer Agatha Christie, who wrote her only spy novel N or M? in the Flats. The Isokon building boasted its own restaurant and dining club, where many of the Flats' most famous residents rubbed shoulders with some of the most dangerous communist spies ever to operate in Britain. Agatha Christie often said that she invented her characters from what she observed going on around her. With the Kuczynskis - probably the most successful family of spies in the history of espionage - in residence, she would have had plenty of material.

It is unique because it is the first ever book which documents and examines intelligence sharing among the US, Uganda, Sudan, and South Sudan against the LRA, and it is written by an insider who served in a senior position in the SPLA at the time. This book will be useful in the fields of intelligence, defence, security, and strategic studies and is fit for use in universities and in military and security academies. It underlines the importance and contribution of intelligence sharing against LRA, a merciless Ugandan rebel movement which has caused havoc in Uganda, South Sudan, DR Congo, and CAR since it started its war against the government of President Museveni in 1986.
Intelligence Sharing Amongst the Unequals argues that since the US, Uganda, Sudan, and South Sudan began sharing intelligence, the LRA capacity has been drastically reduced, making it a much more of a theoretical organisation. When the US announced that its special forces would cease operations against the LRA on 26 April 2017, the UPDF also announced that it would withdraw. Subsequently, South Sudan announced that it would not continue with LRA operations without the support of US and Ugandan forces. This clearly indicates that once the stronger partner leaves, a significant gap is created. Finally, the book argues that unless an intelligence sharing agreement is resumed against the LRA, the chance of the LRA resurfacing can never be ruled out.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/68FUGA3U,2021,Malual Ayom Dor,Africa World Books,,2023-03-20T19:30:14Z,['WHBCJ8GW']

The proliferation of digital technologies empowers civilians to become inevitable actors in all spheres of politics, including war. However, across these practices, I argue that the Ukrainian government and its Western allies harness this agency as operational and narrative weapons.

William J. “Wild Bill” Donovan was on a mission. He had a mandate from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to lead an office that would coordinate American intelligence. But Donovan’s vision was even greater. He wanted to create a one-stop-shop that could conduct the full range of intelligence activities and functions. Donovan set about recruiting a larger-than-life cast of characters to join his new organization. That organization became the Office of Strategic Services or OSS, and it spearheaded the birth of American special operations.
 
Nicholas Reynolds, former CIA operations officer, historian, and best-selling author discusses his new book, Need to Know: World War II and the Rise of American Intelligence. Reynolds addresses myths surrounding Donovan and the OSS while also explaining their role in the Second World War. Count on a few entertaining stories, too, like when Donovan hopped on a 1920s-era wooden biplane to tour a secret OSS camp deep behind enemy lines! Reynolds also offers insights on other topics, including the origins of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance and “special relationship” between American and British intelligence, the development of signals intelligence and its centrality to the war effort, and personal and organizational rivalries that had lasting impacts on the U.S. Intelligence Community

2436,Belgian Strategic Culture: A Historical Perspective on Intelligence and Security in Belgium,Thesis,https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docman/irua/f2a956/194518.pdf,"Rarely have intelligence and the Belgian intelligence and security services been a topic
of discussion as often as in recent years, when the threat of terrorism and the attacks
on Paris and Brussels brought Belgian national security front and center. As the world
and a parliamentary commission of inquiry wondered what went wrong, the need for
a greater understanding about intelligence in Belgium seemed long overdue. For the
problems that have culminated in the failure of the system to prevent the attacks of
2015 and 2016 are not merely current organisational and budgetary issues. They have
deep historical roots that are, like its domestic security service, as old as Belgium itself.
This research asks why the nation that suffered two hostile invasions in the past, and
nowadays hosts the headquarters of NATO and the EU, both high-profile institutions
and therefore attractive targets not just for terrorism but also for espionage, has
seemingly insignificant intelligence services and an underdeveloped strategic culture?
How does Belgian intelligence work and how heavy weighs the influence of the past?
Why do the same pathologies of compartmentalisation, competition,
underachievement, and many other defects keep recurring? Why are security and
intelligence chronically underfunded and neglected by Belgium’s governing bodies?
What is a security culture, why don’t the Belgians have it and what should it then be?
In order to arrive at explanations, the security studies concept of strategic culture is
employed as an interdisciplinary methodology to approach both past and present of
Belgian intelligence, to identify the underlying factors that are the cause of structural
weaknesses, enduring dysfunctions, and strengths. This analytic framework allows for
broader understanding about the capacities of the Belgian intelligence and security
services, the constraints under which they operate, the challenges they face, and the
influence of political and historical factors. Using archival sources, press clippings,
interviews and discussions with insiders, and the reports of the Standing Intelligence
Agencies Review Committee, this study is comprised of a series of published and
unpublished material treating both the historical development of Belgium’s two
intelligence services, as well as recent evolutions with a special focus on the
circumstances in the run-up to the events of 2015 and 2016.
vi
Three historical studies provide the basis for the long-term perspective. The first
chapter considers the intelligence of the Belgian Army before the institution of a
service. Then follows a bird’s eye view of the development of the domestic security
service VSSE from its inception in 1830 to the present. The third chapter describes the
evolution of the military intelligence service ADIV. These articles reveal a body politic
conflicted about security services, an attitude that stems from a liberal distrust of state
power, which defines the difficult relationship of politics with intelligence and the
police. Politicians and government officials deluded themselves into the safety of the
neutrality guarantee and focused on internal subversion but not foreign threats,
questioning the utility of intelligence services along the way.
Security has thus never been a political priority, and the intelligence services stand out
as the stepchildren of government. Lacking a legal framework, misunderstood and
mistrusted by politicians and public alike, there was no interest in their development,
and only marginally in their product. For the most part left to their own devices and
expected to cope on their own, the services from time to time operated beyond the
limits of what was acceptable, culminating in an array of scandals in the 1980s. These
had a tremendous impact on public perception and on the machinery of intelligence,
which from then on had to be strictly regulated. But there was little impulse for reform
beyond addressing the pathologies in the legal framework, which assigned a more
hands-on managerial role to the government, who quickly neglected its responsibility.
Absence of executive management is a common theme throughout these chapters. It
can be seen how even after the scandals in which cooperation between the intelligence
services and with other institutions was shown to be the main defect, government did
very little to redress those shortcomings and the services were allowed to continue in
their old ways of entrenchment and rivalry, only to evolve slowly and reluctantly
towards cooperation. The development of the threat assessment organ OCAD reveals
a similar pathology as shown in the fifth chapter.
Thus problems have been dealt with by ineffective half-measures and legislation that
took years in the making and was lagging behind by the time it eventually became
effective. A consideration of SIGINT capabilities offers a telling example how the 1998
legal framework lacked the most important intelligence collection methods because
they were too politically sensitive and took until 2010 to be allowed. The immaturity of
the framework however made it insufficient to cope with the threat of foreign terrorist
fighters. This is expanded further in Chapter 7 in which the trends of complacency,
indifference, political and financial agendas, as well as the primacy of conforming to
vii
legal standards, have mutually reinforced internal and external—information sharing—
dysfunctions. To provide a comparative perspective, Belgian security history will be
compared with the evolution in neighbouring The Netherlands, which shows a
remarkable amount of parallelisms.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/G7MQ6KVK,January 2023,Kenneth Luc Lasoen,,,2023-03-14T08:03:13Z,"['AZ3BZ9BR', 'NWAKWPT7']"

Our research, based on interviews with over sixty individuals in the Canadian intelligence and national security community and including political staffers, provides a new case study: that of Canada, a middle power with considerable access to intelligence through the Five Eyes partnership. We found that cases of hard politicization of intelligence analysis are virtually non-existent in Canada. The most important factor explaining this finding is Canada’s structural position in the world, or how its geography shapes the broader context of interactions between intelligence and politics. Beyond this, six more specific factors at the domestic level also matter: the relative unimportance of foreign and security policy as political issues, few opportunities, a lack of political benefits, low intelligence literacy generally among policy makers, poor transparency in national security decision making, and a tradition of non-partisanship in the civil service. The paper concludes by reflecting on this assessment: while hard politicization remains a rarity in Canada, the shields that have prevented the emergence of politicization will likely be increasingly tested in the future.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/B2ZYKHZL,2023-03-12,"Thomas Juneau, Stephanie Carvin",,Intelligence and National Security,2023-03-13T18:28:55Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

An understanding of identity grounded in culture suggests a natural process of international intelligence community building, but this was not the case with the Five Eyes. The formation of the grouping was not preordained. Although Anglo-Saxonism was a necessary condition, it was not sufficient. In addition to being able to provide valuable sites for signals intelligence collection, aspiring members had to be seen as staunchly anti-Communist (and therefore politically trustworthy) by the United States in order to become full members of this exclusive community.

2443,HOW THE SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WILL CHANGE AFTER THE RUSSIA – UKRAINE WAR,Journal article,https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=1098741,"Intelligence has changed. Secret Services is no longer just about spying or passively watching a target. Espionage chiefs now command secret armies and legions of cyber warriors who can quietly shape international relations itself. Intelligence actively supports diplomacy, peacekeeping and warfare: the entire spectrum of security activities. As traditional interstate wars become more costly, covert action, black propaganda and other forms of secret interventionism become more important. This ranges from proxy warfare to covert action; from targeted killing to disruption activity. Meanwhile, surveillance permeates communications to the point where many feel there is little privacy. Intelligence, and the accelerating technology that surrounds it, have never been more important for the citizen and the state. We will examine: why states choose to use intelligence – including fabricated intelligence for influencing external audiences, the different methods they deploy for doing so, the gains and costs of publicising intelligence, and how open-source third-parties affect this and, therefore, how the use of intelligence during the Russia-Ukraine conflict should be understood within broader historical and contemporary trends. We conclude that while liberal democracies’ use of intelligence in public is to be welcomed, this will need careful risk management - from sources and methods to public trust and politicization- if it is to become a new normal of statecraft moving forward.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3JQQC63A,December 2022,Ioana Hermina Păiuș,,Defense Resources Management in the 21st Century,2023-03-09T07:49:47Z,['Y959U28A']
2444,Spying Through a Glass Darkly: The Ethics of Espionage and Counter-Intelligence,Book,,"Cécile Fabre draws back the curtain on the ethics of espionage and counterintelligence.Espionage and counter-intelligence activities, both real and imagined, weave a complex and alluring story. Yet there is hardly any serious philosophical work on the subject. Cécile Fabre presents a systematic account of the ethics of espionage and counterintelligence. She argues that such operations, in the context of war and foreign policy, are morally justified as a means, but only as a means, to protect oneself and third parties from ongoing violations of fundamental rights. In doing so, she addresses a range of ethical questions: are intelligence officers morally permitted to bribe, deceive, blackmail, and manipulate as a way to uncover state secrets? Is cyberespionage morally permissible? Are governments morally permitted to resort to the mass surveillance of their and foreign populations as a means to unearth possible threats against national security? Can treason ever be morally permissible? Can it ever be legitimate to resort to economic espionage in the name of national security? The book offers answers to those questions through a blend of philosophical arguments and historical examples.

When he arrived, he was led to a barren room where he waited to meet the man who had summoned him. After a disconcerting amount of time, William “Wild Bill” Donovan, the head of the OSS, walked in the door. “You know your Sherlock Holmes, of course,” Donovan said as an introduction. “Professor Moriarty is the man I want for my staff…I think you’re it.”

Following this life-changing encounter, Lovell became the head of a secret group of scientists who developed dirty tricks for the OSS, the precursor to the CIA. Their inventions included bat bombs, suicide pills, fighting knives, silent pistols, and camouflaged explosives. Moreover, they forged documents for undercover agents, plotted the assassination of foreign leaders, and performed truth drug experiments on unsuspecting subjects.

Based on extensive archival research and personal interviews, The Dirty Tricks Department tells the story of these scheming scientists, explores the moral dilemmas that they faced, and reveals their dark legacy of directly inspiring the most infamous program in CIA history: MKULTRA.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZCPUW3LE,2023-07-03,John Lisle,Macmillan,,2023-03-08T07:15:23Z,['SCCGXHMZ']

To counteract the spread of misinformation, global fact-checking organizations and members of the open-source intelligence (OSINT) community have been gathering, evaluating, and verifying information from open sources in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This research offers a comprehensive examination of the dynamics of the utilization of OSINT for verification during conflict. By interviewing fact-checkers, journalists and OSINT analysts actively engaged with the Ukrainian war we explored what opportunities exist for further collaboration between journalists and the open-source intelligence (OSINT) community in the field of war reporting and verification. The Russian invasion of Ukraine had a notable impact on the expansion of the OSINT community, drawing in a diverse group of participants such as citizen analysts and experts in visual verification. Though the increase in volunteers strengthened the community by providing more resources for content collection, analysis, and verification, it also revealed the necessity for moderation and security within the community. Both journalists and the OSINT community agreed on the need for future collaborations but prefer to begin with informal exchanges of knowledge like workshops. The study found that participants heavily relied upon geolocation for their verification efforts and utilized the findings of OSINT volunteers shared through Geoconfirmed Twitter account. Similarly, OSINT reports were shared through traditional media which helped them reach wider audiences.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Y47JUDLQ,January 2023,Stelios Pournis,,,2023-03-07T08:02:55Z,['Y959U28A']

Drawing on The Bureau (Canal+, 2015–2020), it argues that spy TV series are “realistic” not because they correspond to reality but because of their impact on reality. It begins by giving an overview of the many ways in which “realism,” in the ordinary sense of a resemblance with reality, served as the working framework for The Bureau ’s team. It then identifies three distinct types of realisms in the series. The first is a “fictional realism,” namely the ability of The Bureau to conform to the aesthetic and narrative conventions of realistic fictions. The second type of realism, which I qualify as “ordinary,” refers to the possibilities offered by the show’s aesthetics and the enmeshment of The Bureau with viewers’ ordinary experience. The third type of “performative realism” refers to the series’ impact on shared representations and reality. By providing a common language about the secret activities of the state, The Bureau has gone from being a framed version of reality to being one of the defining frameworks through which state secrecy is experienced both individually and collectively, by insiders and the public at large.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/SL6QGENZ,2022-01-01,Pauline Blistène,,Open Philosophy,2023-03-06T22:14:11Z,['9YH9YSYQ']

Moscow, Washington, Brussels and London miscalculated Ukrainian and Russian military power. Intelligence sharing among EU member states on this catastrophic war posed a dilemma. National Security threat perception and countering foreign espionage strategies in every member state was diversified while their response to international terrorism flattered underwhelming. Intelligence agencies in all EU member states were not sure of the reciprocation of their partners. Some states remarked their security was not under threat. Some intelligence agencies feared that their big partners might not share their national data on terrorism and radicalization. Mistrust and disinformation spread across Europe. In 2020, Boris Johnson’s administration published Russian intelligence report, while in 2022, British intelligence agencies yelled on the interference of Russian and Chinese intelligence agencies. The issue of foreign espionage once more appeared in newspapers, and the British Domestic Intelligence Agency (MI5) abruptly announced that Chinese intelligence agents were making things worse. The MI5 said; “a female Chinese national was engaged in political interference activities on behalf of Beijing”. The death of Alexander Litvinenko and attack on Sergei Skripal prompted development of new perceptions of fear that FSB, and GRU may possibly be interfering in domestic politics. Intelligence agencies across Europe and the UK maintained a very poor record of professional approach to the war in Ukraine. Foreign intelligence agencies in the UK and EU established different espionage, terrorist, and extremist networks to influence policy-making, target their critics and promote subversive activities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/4LUSD2UR,28 February 2023,Musa Khan Jalalzai,Vij Books,,2023-03-06T07:18:40Z,"['HCN8YFI8', 'DVEM4H4W']"

Intelligence aspects of this partnership were also important. The scale of wartime intelligence cooperation is shown by Secret Intelligence Service officer Commander Wilfred Dunderdale’s report and the achievements in a special operation in the history of the Polish Section of the Special Operations Executive. The British were concerned that the files of Polish intelligence and the Sixth Bureau dealing with special operations would fall into Moscow’s hands. They also did not intend to provide the authorities in Warsaw with technical achievements of Polish–British cooperation. The Foreign Office and Joint Intelligence Committee did not want to jeopardize efforts to solve the Polish question with the help from the Soviet Union, which controlled most of the prewar area of Poland. The problem was analyzed based on primary sources: archival documents and memories. Analysis shows that the British were not interested in using the resources of the Sixth Bureau and Polish resistance in Soviet-controlled Poland to prepare for a possible conflict with the Soviet Union.

This goes against basic principles of democratic governance, but it is also counterproductive: the lack of transparency hinders these organizations’ ability to protect national security. This article argues that a broader, proactive definition of transparency should replace traditional perspectives to better support enhanced engagement with minority communities. Next, it explains that for its gains to be sustainable, transparency must be institutionalized into the everyday work of national security organizations. Yet enhancing transparency is easier said than done: while the gains tend to emerge in the longer term, risks emerge in the short term. The article concludes by recognizing that enhancing national security transparency in relations with minority communities, although necessary, is complex and time-consuming, a reality underestimated by some of its proponents in civil society.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FEYB8RD8,2023-03-03,Thomas Juneau,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2023-03-05T09:54:02Z,['DVEM4H4W']

It does so in two steps. First, by challenging the underlying criteria used to demarcate it as a separate “INT” among its more traditional peers. Second, through a historical critique that argues that “OSINT” as a conceptual category served a transitionary stage that has long passed. That is, it helped intelligence practitioners and scholars appreciate the influx of valuable unclassified information made newly available by the World Wide Web in the 1990s, but the advantages gained from this notion have now declined, and the concept is now a liability.

2456,Neither Confirm nor Deny: How the Glomar Mission Shielded the CIA from Transparency,Book,http://cup.columbia.edu/book/neither-confirm-nor-deny/9780231193474,"In 1974, the Hughes Glomar Explorer, ostensibly an advanced deep-sea mining vessel owned by reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, lowered a claw-like contraption to the floor of the Pacific Ocean. This high-tech venture was only a cover story for an even more improbable scheme: a CIA mission to retrieve a sunken Soviet submarine. Like a Jules Verne novel with an Ian Fleming twist, the saga of the Glomar Explorer features underwater espionage, impossible gadgetry, and high-stakes international drama. It also marks a key moment in the history of transparency—and not just for what became known as the Glomar response: “We can neither confirm nor deny. . . . ”M. Todd Bennett plumbs the depths of government secrecy in this new account of the Glomar mission and its consequences. Trawling through recently declassified documents, he explores the logistics, media fallout, and geopolitical significance of one of the most ambitious operations in intelligence history. Glomar, Bennett argues, played a pivotal but underappreciated role in helping the CIA ward off oversight amid a push for transparency and accountability. He reframes the operation’s history to offer an alternative perspective on the 1970s, a decade known for expansive openness, as well as the persistent tension between the demands of democracy and the need for secrecy in foreign policy. Combining keen historical analysis and gripping storytelling, Neither Confirm nor Deny brings to the surface fresh insights into the history of the security state, the politics of intelligence, and the CIA’s relationship with the media and the public.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/68RD6Q5P,2023-01,M.

As the basis of a case study, publicly available committee documents offer valuable insights into accountability practices within an unusual area of government. These documents highlight a range of accountability exchanges and broader relationships, as well as some of their defining features. Exploring critical institutional factors requires conceptual clarity about accountability and what makes it effective or ineffective. An accountability forum can thus be examined as a social mechanism through which the key stages of accountability unfold, at least in theory. Secrecy is a potentially significant intervening variable in this case, but by applying democratic and constitutional perspectives on accountability, some more general strengths and weaknesses are evident.Points for practitionersWhile this institution and the Australian Intelligence Community are distinctive and interesting, empirical and normative understandings are limited. The relationship between accountability and secrecy is also significant but not particularly well understood.

The Hoover FBI's unique position in the federal government was a direct result of its domestic intelligence responsibilities and the particular way internal security concerns were used for ends self-serv ing to the organization. The disparity between the Bureau's carefully cultivated image as a fighter of enemies of the state and its domestic intelligence performance was not revealed until the late 1960s, when the Nixon Administration became dissatisfied with the Bureau's in ability to anticipate the plans of domestic dissenters. This dissatisfac tion culminated in the Huston Plan of 1970. The real ""failure"" of FBI domestic intelligence under Hoover appears to be that it did not pro duce useful information for anticipating and managing dissent. The ""new"" FBI which has emerged in the post-Watergate era has been careful to dissociate itself from the abuses of the Hoover era. It is pointed out that the ""reform"" of domestic intelligence which has taken place has been largely administrative and internal to the ex ecutive branch. The reform has not been designed primarily to pro hibit past abuses, but rather to ensure executive control of intelligence operations.

Yet, no studies have examined the characterization of a national intelligence culture in Canada and proposed to contextualize the Canadian intelligence system in light of its national intelligence culture.

2473,Secretive yet accountable: Formal and informal accountability in the Australian Intelligence Community,Thesis,http://oatd.org/oatd/record?record=handle%5C%3A1885%5C%2F282269,"This research explores different types of accountability within the Australian Intelligence Community (AIC), including democratic, constitutional, learning and reputational accountability. Accountability practices in the intelligence sector and the relationship between accountability and official secrecy are not well understood. Yet the work, practices and impacts of Australia's intelligence agencies have been increasingly significant and visible as these secretive organisations have grown and emerged from the shadows. Accountability can be conceptualised as an important social process that involves interactions between two or more parties. With this lens, this research brings together theory and empirical data to explore who in the AIC has been accountable to whom, for what, why and when. This approach offers new insights into formal and informal accountability practices through the experiences of intelligence agencies, officers and overseers, and builds on existing studies of both accountability and national security. To address gaps in knowledge this research catalogues scholarly concepts of accountability, explores the relevance of these concepts to accountability in the AIC, and documents the development of AIC accountability processes and structures over time. Drawing and analysing data from 32 elite interviews, official documents and media reporting, interpretive case study research is used to explore accountability across three case studies. Case studies focus on three intelligence agencies: the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and its evolving powers in the 2000s and 2010s, the involvement of the Australian Signals Directorate in the 2001 'Tampa affair', and the experiences of the then Office of National Assessments in the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2003 Iraq war. Types of accountability, approaches to transparency, impacts of secrecy and other potential factors in accountability are considered across cases. Control is explored as a significant but distinct counterpart to accountability. Intelligence agencies are not immune to typical or more unusual accountability challenges. But this research shows how both formal and informal types of accountability can occur. It shows how accountability can be hindered by secrecy and more common factors such as account-holders' mandates, resources and influence. The individual practices and perceptions of account-givers and account-holders are also influential due to the secrecy which surrounds intelligence. In the end, strong albeit varying types of accountability are evident, with domestic intelligence collections receiving particular scrutiny, foreign intelligence collections later attention, and less oversight of intelligence assessment functions.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VP78WZR8,February 2023,Richard Bolto,,,2023-02-23T07:10:48Z,"['CK5MNYPQ', 'DVEM4H4W']"

While intelligence is an ancient activity, the digital age is a relatively new phenomenon. This volume uses the concept of the ""digital age"" to highlight the increased change, complexity, and pace of information that is now circulated, as new technology has reduced the time it takes to spread news to almost nothing. These factors mean that decision-makers face an increasingly challenging threat environment, which in turn increases the demand for timely, relevant, and reliable intelligence to support policymaking. In this context, the book demonstrates that intelligence places greater demands on analysis work, as the traditional intelligence cycle is no longer adequate as a process description. In the digital age, it is not enough to accumulate as much information as possible to gain a better understanding of the world. To meet customers’ needs, the intelligence process must be centred around the analysis work – which in turn has increased the demand for analysts. Assessments, not least predictions, are now just as important as revealing someone else’s secrets.

Established in 1948 as part of the emerging U.S. national security apparatus, this communications intelligence organization was meant to place the fledgling U.S. Air Force on a competitive footing with its Army and Navy counterparts.  As World War II ended and the Cold War began, Air Force leaders understood that an effective cryptologic capability would be crucial for maintaining and enhancing the Air Force as a strategic and decisive component of America’s national defense. Successfully deploying air-atomic strategy in the event of a future war would require reliable information on the capabilities, intentions—and potential targets—of an opposing force, in particular the Soviet Union. Communications intelligence would be a critical source of this information, and Air Force leaders were adamant that their service not remain dependent on other service structures for this capability. The Air Force Security Service rose to the occasion, quickly establishing itself as one of the preeminent communications intelligence agencies in the United States.

Rise of the Mavericks fills the gap in the military and intelligence history literature and further complicates the literature surrounding the history of the NSA, which too often ignores or hastily addresses the contributions and role of the service COMINT agencies during the early Cold War period. The book explains how Air Force Security Service personnel were viewed as mavericks by other U.S. military and government organizations.

These are a compilation of the files maintained by the Intelligence Branch of Pakistan Government on Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who emerged as the sole leader of the country and became Bangabandhu (Friend of Bangladesh). For his long-standing struggle and contribution in fostering notions of Bengali nationhood that led to the independence of Bangladesh, he has been honored as the Father of the Nation.

The volumes provide records for period 1948 to 1971 and chronologically elucidate the trajectory of the various movements and political struggles that led to the formation of an independent nation state called People's Republic of Bangladesh. These include the 1952 Bengali Language Movement that catalyzed the assertion of Bengali national identity in the region and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led the struggle for independence, first through massive populist and civil disobedience movements and later during the　Bangladesh Liberation War. Important events cited in the present volumes include the 1954 United Front election victory, 1966 Six Point Movement, 1968 Agartala Conspiracy Case, 1969 mass uprising, 1970 election victory and 1971 Non-Cooperation Movement among others.

These are the first ever declassified documents released by the Government of Bangladesh and will serve as an invaluable historical resource in understanding the liberation of Bangladesh.

States with Ukraine. The analysis is made primarily with the law of neutrality
and the Charter of the United Nations in focus but also draws on the work of
legal scholars for specific insights into international law.
Details on military intelligence are rarely publicly disclosed which entails
complexities with conducting case studies. This analysis is therefore of a
general nature, although only considering the international armed conflict
between Russia and Ukraine.
The essay concludes that the intelligence sharing is illegal under the
traditional law of neutrality, i.e. as it is formulated in the Hague Conventions
of 1907, because it violates the principle of impartiality. However, it may be
legal provided that a distinctive form of the law of neutrality, called qualified
neutrality, is considered to be valid. On the contrary, it concludes that the
sharing of intelligence is legal under the UN Charter since it would be
considered a measure of collective self-defence according to Art. 51 of the
UN Charter.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/NALBWLZH,September 2022,Oskar Jönsson,,,2023-02-16T09:13:50Z,['Y959U28A']

2488,The Declassification Engine: what history reveals about America’s top secrets,Book,https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/545793/the-declassification-engine-by-matthew-connelly/,"Before World War II, transparent government was a proud tradition in the United States. In all but the most serious of circumstances, classification, covert operations, and spying were considered deeply un-American. But after the war, the power to decide what could be kept secret proved too tempting to give up. Since then, we have radically departed from that open tradition, allowing intelligence agencies, black sites, and classified laboratories to grow unchecked. Officials insist that only secrecy can keep us safe, but its true costs have gone unacknowledged for too long.

Using the latest techniques in data science, historian Matthew Connelly analyzes a vast trove of state secrets to unearth not only what the government really does not want us to know but also why they don’t want us to know it. Culling this research and carefully examining a series of pivotal moments in recent history, from Pearl Harbor to drone warfare, Connelly sheds light on the drivers of state secrecy—especially incompetence and criminality—and how rampant overclassification makes it impossible to protect truly vital information.

What results is an astonishing study of power: of the greed it enables, of the negligence it protects, and of what we lose as citizens when our leaders cannot be held to account. A crucial examination of the self-defeating nature of secrecy and the dire state of our nation’s archives, The Declassification Engine is a powerful reminder of the importance of preserving the past so that we may secure our future.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/LFJTURF8,14 February 2023,Matthew Connelly,Pantheon,,2023-02-15T09:24:54Z,['RHJFPRAI']

The brazen attack in central London, Markov’s public profile and the alleged use of an exotic spy gadget (a poison umbrella) made the murder one of the Cold War’s most infamous cases of political assassination. However, despite wide-spread suspicions the case formally remains open, with the British government taking only limited actions against Bulgaria, the presumed culprit. This article draws on recently declassified archival materials from the United Kingdom to provide the first historical account focusing on the British dimensions of the case. The article discusses Markov’s journey to London, his murder and the British government’s response. It argues that the limited response to Markov’s murder largely followed uncertainty regarding the identity of the assassin and culpability of the Bulgarian state, as well as the political climate in the twilight years of détente. In contrast, British authorities responded tentatively to the attack on Litvinenko in 2006 and much more decisively to the attack on Skripal in 2018.

Two main theories have been advanced. First, ?means-based? theory argues attack type determines response; cyber attacks are less likely to escalate than kinetic attacks. Second, ?effects-based? theory argues an attack?s material consequences determine the likelihood of retaliation. We advance a third perspective, arguing that the covertness of an attack has the largest effect on its propensity towards escalation. We identify two characteristics of covertness that affect support for retaliation: the certainty of attribution and its timing. We use a survey experiment to assess public support for retaliation, while varying the means, effects, timing, and attribution certainty of attacks. We find no evidence for the effects-based approach, instead finding high levels of support for retaliation regardless of an attack?s scale. We find that the most significant contributor to support for retaliation is an attack?s covertness.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/94UYESJ7,2023-02-01,"Kathryn Hedgecock, Lauren Sukin",,Journal of Conflict Resolution,2023-02-06T14:25:30Z,['8XXD789V']

2517,Why HAL 9000 is not the future of intelligence analysis: Intelligence analysis in the 21st century,Journal article,https://journals.lib.sfu.ca/index.php/jicw/article/view/2566,"Intelligence analysis is a core function of the intelligence process, and its goal is to synthesize reliable information to assist decision-makers to take a course of action toward an uncertain future. There is no escape from uncertainty, friction, and the fog of war. Since the dawn of human history, the present moment has been experienced as unpredictable, and the challenge of determining the right future through sound decisions has always existed. Investing in new technology, continually touted as the answer for analytic troubles, seems far less difficult in the short run than trying to find consensus about a long-term vision. It is easier to develop a nuclear missile, for example, than to give a universal definition of peace, and this is what the history of the XX century was all about. While intelligence analysis is still a necessary tool for decision-makers, it is unclear who or what will perform this function in the future. Though the solution cannot be only technological, the current trajectory tells a different story whereby the human analysts are removed from their central position to make way for Artificial Intelligence.

Drawing from critical intelligence studies, this article will argue that the goal of accountability is to expand legitimacy by incorporating the civil society. This requires redeveloping the scope of intelligence and its audience beyond legal norms and traditional decision-makers. To do so, the article will consider the following actors: 1) the media; 2) whistleblowers and leaks; 3) scholars; and 4) fiction writers. These actors may complement intelligence by gathering information or acting as knowledge advisory groups. Moreover, they can also challenge intelligence by promoting deeper scrutiny and transparency, while constructing archetypes that represent secret agencies. The conclusion will summarize the strengths and limitations deriving from these actors to promote accountability. It will also claim that, through a critical approach, exploring new accountability forms are necessary to expand the social legitimacy of intelligence policies.

I then examine le Carré’s development of a thesis on Bond as a figure whose consumerist qualities negated any moral core, an idea later developed into a subversion of the Bond persona in The Tailor of Panama (1996).

From the Soviet Union to South Africa and Libya, Mark Wilkinson provides a detailed analysis and vivid account of the development and functioning of Britain's intelligence agencies in the struggle against the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. Based on archival research and interviews with key players in the intelligence establishment, he shows how a handful of chemical and biological weapons experts battled to make their voices heard.

It argues that intelligence accountability is best understood not as an end in itself but as a means that is integral democratic governance. On the one hand, to assure the executive of government and the public that the activities of intelligence agencies are lawful and, if not, to identify breaches in compliance. On the other hand, to raise awareness of and appreciation for the intelligence function, and whether it is being carried out in the most effective, efficient, and innovative way possible to achieve its objective. The analysis shows how the addition of legislative and judicial components to executive and administrative accountability has been shaping evolving institutions, composition, practices, characteristics, and cultures of intelligence oversight and review in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand using a most-similar systems design. Democracies are engaged in an asymmetric struggle against unprincipled adversaries. Technological change is enabling unprecedented social and political disruption.

2537,National Intelligence and Science: Beyond the Great Divide in Analysis and Policy,Book,https://global.oup.com/academic/product/national-intelligence-and-science-9780199360864,"Intelligence is currently facing increasingly challenging cross-pressures from both a need for accurate and timely assessments of potential or imminent security threats and the unpredictability of many of these emerging threats. We are living in a social environment of growing security and intelligence challenges, yet the traditional, narrow intelligence process is becoming increasingly insufficient for coping with diffuse, complex, and rapidly-transforming threats. The essence of intelligence is no longer the collection, analysis, and dissemination of secret information, but has become instead the management of uncertainty in areas critical for overriding security goals--not only for nations, but also for the international community as a whole. For its part, scientific research on major societal risks like climate change is facing a similar cross-pressure from demand on the one hand and incomplete data and developing theoretical concepts on the other. For both of these knowledge-producing domains, the common denominator is the paramount challenges of framing and communicating uncertainty and of managing the pitfalls of politicization.

National Intelligence and Science is one of the first attempts to analyze these converging domains and the implications of their convergence, in terms of both more scientific approaches to intelligence problems and intelligence approaches to scientific problems. Science and intelligence constitute, as the book spells out, two remarkably similar and interlinked domains of knowledge production, yet ones that remain traditionally separated by a deep political, cultural, and epistemological divide.

Looking ahead, the two twentieth-century monoliths--the scientific and the intelligence estates--are becoming simply outdated in their traditional form. The risk society is closing the divide, though in a direction not foreseen by the proponents of turning intelligence analysis into a science, or the new production of scientific knowledge.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YHPHHLPX,2015-01-02,"Wilhelm Agrell, Gregory F.

After distinguished service as artillery officer and aide-de-camp to General Haig during the First World War, Morton worked for the Secret Intelligence Service from 1919-1934, and the fortunes of SIS in the interwar years are described here in unprecedented detail. As Director of the Industrial Intelligence Centre in the 1930s, Morton’s warnings of Germany’s military and industrial preparations for war were widely read in Whitehall, though they failed to accelerate British rearmament as much as Morton - and Churchill - considered imperative. Morton had met Churchill on the Western Front in 1916 and supported him throughout the ‘wilderness years’, moving to Downing Street as the Prime Minister’s Intelligence adviser in May 1940. There he remained in a liaison role, with the Intelligence Agencies and with Allied resistance authorities, until the end of the war, when he became a ‘troubleshooter’ for the Treasury in a series of tricky international assignments. Throughout Morton’s career, myth, rumour and deliberate obfuscation have created a misleading picture of his role and influence. This book shines a light into many hitherto shadowy corners of British history in the first half of the twentieth century.

This has been mostly treated as a simple outcome of the change of power. However, this article offers a different perspective on the abolition of spying in 1908 and the subsequent exile of the spies in 1909. This study focuses on the abolition of spying in the Ottoman Empire as a significant idea shaped since the earlier years of the Young Turks' opposition to the rule of Abdülhamid II and followed strictly as a policy after they assumed power. Rather than treating abolition of spying and the exile of spies as a byproduct of the 1908 Revolution, this study takes it as one of the pillars of the Young Turks' ideological discourse and a central policy of the CUP. The article maintains a thread from the origins of Young Turk aversion to spying to the exile of the spies in 1909 following the 31 March Incident. This research aims to contribute to the social history of the late Ottoman historiography by placing the abolition of spying into a larger context together with its agents– the spies.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/CFMJLBS6,2022,Arda Akıncı,,Journal of the Ottoman and Turkish Studies Association,2023-01-27T09:25:18Z,['9DTPTK46']

Unsparing in its accounts of dirty tricks and their consequences, it values the agency's intelligence and analysis work to offer balanced judgements that avoid both celebration and condemnation of the CIA. The mission of the CIA, derived from U-1 in World War I more than from World War II's OSS, has always been intelligence. Seventy-five years ago, in the year of its creation, the National Security Act gave the agency, uniquely in world history up to that point, a democratic mandate to pursue that mission of intelligence. It gave the CIA a special standing in the conduct of US foreign relations. That standing diminished when successive American presidents ordered the CIA to exceed its original mission. When they tasked the agency secretly to overthrow democratic governments, the United States lost its international standing, and its command of a majority in the United Nations General Assembly. Such dubious operations, even the government's embrace of assassination and torture, did not diminish the standing of the CIA in US public opinion. However, domestic interventions did. CIA spying on domestic protesters led to tighter congressional oversight from the 1970s on.The chapters in A Question of Standing offer a balanced narrative and perspective on recognizable episodes in the CIA's history. They include the Bay of Pigs invasion, the War on Terror, 9/11, the weapons of mass destruction deception, the Iran estimate of 2007, the assassination of Osama bin Laden, and Fake News. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 diminished the CIA and is construed as having been the right solution undertaken for the wrong reasons, reasons that grew out of political opportunism.

The level of intelligence synthesis, informative and advisory nature of the Intelligence Community, and available human resources are three organizational factors that can be used to study the requirements and career-spanning effects tasking has for an analyst and their manager. Ultimately, human resources do have a big part to play, but should not be the only guiding factor. Tasking should consider the lifetime development of an analyst.

The United States historically has provided billions of dollars in military and economic aid to intelligence liaison partners that host intelligence collections facilities or support joint covert operations. While many of these relationships are characterized by trust and mutual benefit, others are subject to a constant struggle for control. Unlike the scrutiny paid to overt base negotiations, this clandestine bargaining largely has been overlooked in intelligence and International Relations literature. This review of the negotiations surrounding the U.S.–Pakistani joint covert operations in Afghanistan during the 1980s addresses this void.

I situate Canada’s new legislation against the backdrop of US and Japanese legislative responses and analyze the transition, including Bill C-13 (2014), Bill C-44 (2015), Bill C-51 (2015), and Bill C-59 (2019). I argue that the thrust of this legislative trend has been the active legalization of previously illegal surveillance activities by security intelligence agencies, rather than passive ineffectiveness in restricting state mass surveillance enabled by information and communication technologies. The transition is in synch with a global legislative trend that lowers the legal standards of privacy and personal data protection and weakens checks and balances in democratic governance. As a result, mass surveillance has increasingly undermined and regulated the rule of law, not vice versa., RésuméCet article offre une perspective transnationale sur la réponse législative du Canada à l’élargissement à l’échelle mondiale des activités de renseignement pour la sécurité nationale dans la guerre contre le terrorisme depuis 2001. Je situe la nouvelle législation du Canada dans le contexte des réponses législatives américaines et japonaises et j’analyse la transition, notamment avec le projet de loi C-13 (2014), le projet de loi C-44 (2015), le projet de loi C-51 (2015) et le projet de loi C-59 (2019). Je soutiens que l’idée maîtresse de cette évolution législative a été la légalisation active des activités de surveillance, auparavant illégales, par les services de renseignement de sécurité, plutôt qu’une inefficacité passive à restreindre la surveillance de masse de l’État rendue possible par les technologies de l’information et de communication. Cette transition est en phase avec la tendance législative mondiale à réduire les normes juridiques de protection de la vie privée et des données personnelles et à affaiblir les freins et les contrepoids dans la gouvernance démocratique. Par conséquent, la surveillance de masse mine de plus en plus l’État de droit, cette surveillance devient même une force régulatrice de l’État de droit plutôt que l’inverse.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/EQ8TEITG,2022/08,Midori Ogasawara,,Canadian Journal of Law and Society / La Revue Canadienne Droit et Société,2023-01-23T22:26:26Z,"['CK5MNYPQ', 'DVEM4H4W']"

Keen to reduce its dependency on the outgoing British colonial administration, Ghana sought India’s support when both the Cold War rivalry and the Afro-Asian Solidarity were at a peak. In doing so, Ghana inherited a similar set of problems affecting Indian intelligence, which in itself was supported by the British i.e. resorting to colonial policing methods, lack of legislative oversight, and a recruitment system based on partisan loyalties instead of professionalism. The Foreign Service Research Bureau (external intelligence) and the Special Branch (domestic intelligence) effectively secured Ghana’s first prime minister and then president Kwame Nkrumah from real and perceived adversaries. But their methods of functioning fed his authoritarian appetite –ultimately leading to an unceremonious ouster– during a highly turbulent phase in Ghanaian history. The first and only time India helped create, and unofficially lead, another country’s intelligence service, this history sheds light on India and Ghana’s approach towards intelligence in the aftermath of independence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/99Q6PEZ9,2022-07-04,Avinash Paliwal,,The International History Review,2023-01-23T22:29:13Z,"['CZT6L9T7', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

The company was controlled by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). The Swiss intelligence services had known about this intelligence operation since 1993 at the latest, had access to relevant information, and allowed the foreign intelligence services to continue their operation until 2018. For the permanently neutral State of Switzerland, this raises the question of how Operation RUBICON is to be assessed with regard to Switzerland's duties under the law of neutrality.
This author finds that it was unlikely that Switzerland, in its complicity in Operation RUBICON, violated its duties under the law of neutrality. However, if—and this is unlikely but cannot be completely ruled out—Crypto AG exported rigged cipher machines or offered maintenance services during (or immediately before) the Kosovo War in 1999 to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, or during (or immediately before) the Iraq invasion in 2003 to the Republic of Iraq, Switzerland would have violated its duties under the law of neutrality. At the very least, Switzerland's complicity in Operation RUBICON plays into its image as a Western neutral and is therefore relevant in terms of Swiss neutrality policy. In any case, it is crucial for Switzerland to refrain from complying with intelligence operations such as Operation RUBICON and to preserve (guided by equidistance, international law, and Switzerland's humanitarian tradition) its permanent neutrality, even during today's challenging circumstances.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/INUPP3I6,18 January 2023,Manuel Rodriguez,,International Journal of Legal Information,2023-01-21T10:57:38Z,"['T92JK7A5', 'CZT6L9T7']"

When Japanese soldiers were taken as prisoners of war, who interrogated them? When Japanese maps and plans were captured on the battlefield, who deciphered them for Britain? 

When Great Britain found itself at war with Japan in December 1941, there was a linguistic battle to be fought—but Britain was hopelessly unprepared. Eavesdropping on the Emperor traces the men and women with a talent for languages who were put on crash courses in Japanese, and unfolds the history of their war. Some were sent with their new skills to India; others to Mauritius, where there was a secret radio intercept station; or to Australia, where they worked with Australian and American codebreakers. 

 Translating the despatches of the Japanese ambassador in Berlin after his conversations with Hitler; retrieving filthy but valuable documents from the battlefield in Burma; monitoring Japanese airwaves to warn of air-raids—Britain depended on these forgotten ‘war heroes’. The accuracy of their translations was a matter of life or death, and they rose to the challenge.

2578,The hidden geography of transnational surveillance: social and technological networks around signals intelligence sites,Thesis,http://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/handle/10443/3614,"This thesis investigates the hidden geography of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) sites, state military bases concerned with the interception, interpretation and communication of information transmitted through technological systems. Focusing on three such sites in North Yorkshire, Fylingdales, Irton Moor, and primarily, Menwith Hill, it examines their histories and functions, and the discourses of different actors and interest groups about these processes and places. The histories, functions and discursive constructions of SIGINT sites are examined using a theoretical framework of surveillance theory, an emerging transdisciplinary field which understands that surveillance, the monitoring and control of actors, is as important to the analysis of contemporary societies as production. The thesis analyses the sites as part of a hidden geography of transnational surveillance and ultimately weaponry. This geography encompasses not only the places themselves, but also socio-technological networks that stretch across land, air, sea, outer space, and the virtual realm. The thesis is an attempt to trace some of this hidden geography, to assign it history and social meaning, and to subject it to critical interpretation. The thesis adopts a semiotic discourse analysis methodology informed by Actor-Network Theory to analyse the data gathered. The concept of discourse, the whole array of ways in which actors describe themselves, others and the world around them, is central to the way in which the thesis examines the evidence relating to SIGINT sites. This evidence includes officially generated and unofficial written documents, academic and non-academic analysis, visual representations, and interviews with key actors. Because these networks of sites are hidden, it does not mean that they cannot be made visible and their presence in the landscape and in society contested. The semiotic structure of the sites has come under attack from actors who derive meanings from their viewing of these places that are at odds with official state discourse, wherein the necessity of surveillance and secret intelligence are bound up with the foundations of the state and with inter-state relationships. This thesis will examine the whole spectrum of rejection: civil rights and privacy campaigners, peace activists, politicians and parapoliticians, Ufologists and conspiracists. These counter-discourses challenge official discourses in different ways, with differing intensities, and with varied outcomes, from failure to appropriation by the state to success in adjusting or supplanting official discourses and practices. The thesis raises questions about the development of the contemporary capitalist state and its relationship to its people and to other states and peoples. Drawing on recent adaptations of complexity theory to the social sciences, and the work of Foucault, Lyon and Chomsky, the trajectory of societies is considered to be strongly influenced by a dynamic tension between the tendency towards panopticism, a total surveillance society, and opposing tendencies towards individual and collective liberation.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VKANFRCL,2001,David Wood,,,2023-01-15T23:40:59Z,['T92JK7A5']

This thesis aims to explain how and why SIGINT was protected from public disclosure during and after the war, how it became public in 1974, and how WWII historiography has evolved as a consequence of these revelations. Drawing on a vast range of published sources, interviews and recently available archival and electronic-database material, this thesis is comprised of five chapters. With a brief overview of important precedents, the first chapter traces Pacific theatre SIGINT disclosures from WWII through its early and detailed, although not complete, disclosure during the Pearl Harbour hearings and beyond. The second chapter examines how and why the Ultra secret was kept, despite the belief of the gatekeepers that it would soon be discovered by historians analysing operational details and battlefield decisions. The third chapter reviews chronologically the not insignificant Ultra-related disclosures that went unnoticed by historians prior to the publication of F. W. Winterbotham’s <i>The Ultra secret </i>in 1974. The fourth chapter presents the most complete explanation to date of why Winterbotham was allowed to publish, including a review of important precedents. The fifth chapter follows WWII historiographical development through to the end of the century as Ultra disclosures changed the understanding of the war in Europe and rejuvenated historical interest in Pacific theatre communications intelligence. Finally, an epilogue offers several Cold War historiographical comparisons that provide insight in to Anglo-American SIGINT disclosure and historical understanding of intelligence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VIJBG2KS,2005,R.

Drawing upon archives in Britain and Cyprus, and a range of published primary sources, a fresh contribution to First World War intelligence studies is offered through a focus on British counter-espionage efforts in Cyprus after 1916. The article covers Anglo-French intelligence cooperation on the Syrian and Cilician coast, the wartime loyalties of Cypriots and their value as spies, and insights into Ottoman and German human intelligence activity in the region. The primary focus is on the civil-military relations between the Cyprus colonial government and the military intelligence officers. It is argued that Cyprus acquired some importance as a post for intelligence-gathering and especially counter-espionage, but the problems derived from inadequate civil-military relations, disloyal Cypriot subjects, and the island?s status as a backwater hindered its development as a valuable asset in the Near and Middle East theatre.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/AKESRSWZ,2012-07-01,Andrekos Varnava,,War in History,2023-01-12T10:27:46Z,"['BNPYHVD4', '4BH8AYZE']"

It focuses on the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) and its wartime activities on behalf of the British intelligence service. Evidence is presented on the role of the RGS in the dispute between the so-called 'westerners', committed to an all-out clash with Germany on the western front, and the 'easterners', who argued that the key to deadlock in western Europe lay in the Ottoman Empire. For a short period, the RGS became a significant metropolitan focus for those advocating a British intervention in the Middle East coupled with an Arab revolt against the Turks, the campaign popularly associated with T E Lawrence. The essay concludes with an assessment of the significance of geography to the British war effort and an evaluation of the impact of the war on the institutions and prestige of the discipline.

But even though it is generally agreed that intelligence is of little use unless it is received and understood by policymakers, we actually know little about why some leaders are receptive toward intelligence, while others are not. This article argues that the willingness of decision- makers to listen to intelligence depends primarily on two factors: their belief in the seriousness of the issue or threat involved, and their trust in the utility of intelligence. It examines contrasting receptivity toward intelligence in the cases of Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway, and suggests that our current models of intelligence–policy relations need to be revised.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/92I43ZJ9,2013,Erik J.

Up to the start of the Nixon administration, the civilian leadership of the Department of Defense had found CIA estimates of Soviet strategic capabilities congenial, because they contradicted the inherent tendency of military intelligence to exaggerate them.

They acted on Moscow's behalf as a check upon the communist parties of the satellite states themselves. The Soviet leaders were aware of the fragility of the communist parties which they had brought to power in Eastern Europe after 1945. The satellite secret police agencies provided information about the developments inside the local parties from the grassroots to the level of the politburo; and, in the event of the collapse of the local communist party, the secret police might provide the only means of preserving Soviet control. How this system operated in East Germany is examined. (Quotes from original text)",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XZNGFBSD,1998,Richard J.

It advances three major arguments. First, efforts to assess and improve warning forecasts must take into account the policy context in which they are made and used. They cannot be based on concerns with the accuracy of forecasts alone. Second, important biases are present in retrospective case studies. Therefore, we should accept post hoc explanations of warning failures with appropriate caution. Third, a pluralistic intelligence community, as it is presently proposed for some non-U.S. systems, is unlikely to resolve the problems thought to be responsible for past strategic surprises. It may in fact compound these problems.

As an informal mechanism, how do they fit into the wider landscape of intelligence oversight? By drawing on examples of US counter-terrorism efforts in the post-9/11 era, the article identifies three roles for the news media in intelligence oversight: as an information transmitter and stimulator for formal scrutinizers, as a substitute watchdog and as a legitimizing institution. Yet there is a danger of the news media acting merely as a lapdog. Other limitations include the impact of regulatory frameworks, government secrecy and the media strategies of intelligence services.

The growing connectivity between both foreign intelligence services and also domestic security services means that we might speak - not just of growing international co-operation - but perhaps even of global co-operation. This essay considers the complex interplay of intelligence and globalization since 1989. It argues that there is an obvious tension between a developing global style of co-operative activity and the traditional mechanisms of oversight, which have tended to be national. Accordingly, it moves on to discuss the recent efforts by national, regional and international systems of inquiry to examine issues that involve intelligence co-operation. It suggests that while formal committee-type mechanisms have limited purchase, they are not the only options for oversight in a globalized context.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/M8H9CSMP,2009,Richard J.

Indeed, many in both political and intelligence circles argue for access to ever greater amounts of cyber information in order to catch potential threats before they become real. By collecting all our digital information, the intelligence community argues that it is not only able to detail what people have done or are currently doing but also predict what their next move might be. However, the ethical implications are unclear and the backlash following Edward Snowden’s revelations have shown that such activities are not without controversy. This leaves the debate stuck between the important, ethical role that intelligence can play and the potential for its unrestrained use to cause undue harm. This paper will resolve this by giving greater detail to cyber-intelligence practices, highlighting the different levels of harm that the various intelligence operations can cause. The essence of this paper is not that cyber-intelligence should be banned outright, but that it can be justified given the necessary circumstances. Therefore, the paper will develop a specialised set of Just Cyber-Intelligence Principles, built on the just war tradition, to outline if and when such activities are justified.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Q99CRRBH,2016,R.

The work looks at whether there is a distinct way in which India ‘thinks about’ and ‘does’ intelligence, and, by extension, whether this affects the prospects of it being surprised. Drawing on a combination of archival data, secondary source information and interviews with members of the Indian security and intelligence community, the book provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of Indian intelligence culture from the ancient period to colonial times and, subsequently, the post-colonial era. This evolutionary culture has played a significant role in explaining the India’s foreign intelligence failure during the occurrences of strategic surprises, such as the 1962 Sino-Indian War and the 1999 Kargil War, while it successfully prepared for surprise attacks like Operation Chenghiz Khan by Pakistan in 1971. The result is that the book argues that the strategic culture of a nation and its interplay with intelligence organisations and operations is important to understanding the conditions for intelligence failures and strategic surprises.

Data collection now plays a central role in intelligence practice, yet this development raises a host of ethical and national security problems, such as: privacy; autonomy; threats to national security and democracy by foreign states; and accountability for liberal democracies. This volume provides a comprehensive set of in-depth ethical analyses of these problems by combining contributions from both ethics scholars and intelligence practitioners. It provides the reader with a practical understanding of relevant operations, the issues that they raise, and analysis of how responses to these issues can be informed by a commitment to liberal democratic values. This combination of perspectives is crucial in providing an informed appreciation of ethical challenges that is also grounded in the realities of the practice of intelligence.

Its beginnings, however, may be traced back to the days of the Pharaohs. A letter records the intention of a foreigner to determine the meaning of fires raised by the Egyptians.1 (No one knows if he succeeded.)

The Germans had full confidence in the Enigma: the scrambler of the machine was such an elaborate one, with three rotors and a plugboard, and the number of possible encoding positions for each letter was such an immensely huge one (it was around 5000 billion trillion trillion trillion trillion, or 5 followed by 87 zeros)2 that they believed their cypher to be absolutely unbreakable. Their opponents nevertheless had succeeded in breaking it since January 1940. This was the result of the joint effort of two teams of cryptologists, one in Britain and the other in France. The British team was working at Bletchley, in Buckinghamshire (a now very famous name, but which remained top secret up to 1974), where the Government Code and Cypher School had moved in August 1939.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VVG6QNJL,1984,Jean Stengers,Macmillan Education UK,,2023-01-10T00:11:28Z,"['T92JK7A5', 'MP7FJ9UA', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

However, for most of the interwar period, the Secret Service proper (MI6 or SIS) was a small, fringe organisation. It was understaffed, underpaid, and could run few agents abroad, while the cryptanalysts of GC&CS provided a disappointingly limited access to the coded radio traffic of both Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Russia. The main work of intelligence assessment was conducted by a wider bureaucracy, which utilised both covert and public sources of information. Military intelligence work was done by the three service departments, each concentrating in an independent fashion on the rearmament of its German opposite number. Economic intelligence was gathered by the Industrial Intelligence Centre (IIC). A limited coordination of this material was achieved by the Chiefs of Staff (COS).

The historical origins of these three secret agencies are very different. In France there is an almost continuous history of diplomatic codebreaking stretching back to the cabinet noir founded by Cardinal Richelieu. In Britain the Foreign Office inherited an official ‘decypherer on its foundation in 1782 but abolished the post in 1844 and abandoned codebreaking altogether for the next seventy years. The United States lived in a state of cryptographic innocence until its entry into the First World War prompted the creation of its first ‘Black Chamber’ (so named in honour of the French original).

Supporters of the president downplay White House responsibility and focus instead on the failings of the intelligence community and the possible need for structural reforms. Neither side has it completely wrong - or right. There is substantial evidence that the Bush administration - like many of its predecessors - oversold the threat to sell its preferred policy choice. But any quest to 'fix' intelligence merely through reorganisation will be futile insofar as it avoids the more prosaic but more critical matter of intelligence effectiveness.

Rather the evidence suggests that misconceptions about Egyptian military capability were more important.

2730,Eight: Intelligence failure,Book chapter,https://doi.org/10.51952/9781447326427.ch008,"As was highlighted earlier, much of our understanding of intelligence practice comes not from policing, which largely has hidden this facet of its work from public view, but from SIAs. Such knowledge is derived in particular from the US intelligence community, which for many years has encouraged research into its practices and has endorsed both publication of research findings and scholarly reflection on the themes that have emerged from them (often under the auspices of bodies such as the US National Institute of Justice or the Central Intelligence Agency’s Center for the Study of Intelligence). There now is a relatively large body of scholarly research on intelligence failure on which practitioners can draw. There is much less on intelligence success and that is bound to skew the public’s perception of the work. That is just as true of policing as it is of the security milieu. US academic (and national security ‘insider’) Richard K. Betts and a second US academic (and former US Navy intelligence analyst) ErikJ. Dahl persuasively have argued that no matter how many resources the intelligence community is able to call on, no matter how many analytical processes it develops, no matter how much data it collects, crises or calamities – that in the modern era have come to be labelled intelligence ‘failures’ – are inevitable. Against that background, the following questions are posed: To what extent are those analyses applicable to the UK policing milieu? Does the increasing emphasis on big data obscure the intrinsic value of ‘little data’ to intelligence success? What efforts are the police making to manage the risks associated with intelligence failure? The phrase actionable intelligence is a relatively modern creation that links action and intelligence and, intentionally or otherwise (its genesis may have been a calculated act or simply an etymological quirk), invests the product of that association with a utility that neither, on its own, possesses.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9RA3D6WQ,2016/04/27,Adrian James,Policy Press,,2023-01-09T20:17:44Z,['D7XFV7JL']

It explores the extent to which four factors - failures of public policy leadership, analytical challenges, organizational obstacles, and the inherent problems of warning information - contribute to intelligence failure. This study applies existing theories of surprise and intelligence failure to case studies of five mass casualty terrorism incidents: World Trade Center 1993; Oklahoma City 1995; Khobar Towers 1996; East African Embassies 1998; and September 11, 2001. A structured, focused comparison of the cases is made using a set of thirteen probing questions based on the factors above. The study concludes that while all four factors were influential, failures of public policy leadership contributed directly to surprise. Psychological bias and poor threat assessments prohibited policy makers from anticipating or preventing attacks. Policy makers mistakenly continued to use a law enforcement approach to handling terrorism, and failed to provide adequate funding, guidance, and oversight of the intelligence community. The study has implications for intelligence reform, information sharing, Congressional oversight, and society's expectations about the degree to which the intelligence community can predict or prevent surprise attacks.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/DMRNQX7D,2006-05-04,Thomas Edgar Copeland,,,2023-01-09T20:06:36Z,"['D7XFV7JL', 'TLFN4NAL', '9YPHGMBS']"

Most importantly, this article asserts that the Intelligence Community should: first, acknowledge the results of the debate, and second, take a major step by committing to a uniform set of standards (indicators and methodology), which combine intuition and structured technique, for the standing intelligence warning topics. Recommendations for implementation are described in a proposed methodology model that identifies a uniform set of standards to improve intelligence warning.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/KE3RKN94,2009-04-01,Sundri Khalsa,,Journal of Conflict Studies,2023-01-09T19:58:43Z,['9YPHGMBS']

But this has not always been the case, even for Great Britain, which is generally regarded as the world leader in counter-insurgency. By examining operational experience, doctrine and training, and professional writing on the subject, this article will show how intelligence emerged as a centerpiece of British counter-insurgency theory and practice in the post-1945 era. It will demonstrate that the British experienced a steep learning curve. Sound theory and practice were no guarantee of success, since victory or defeat was determined largely by local conditions and British political considerations. And some intelligence practices that had been effective in distant conflicts proved problematic when applied in the domestic arena of Northern Ireland. Ultimately, British counter-insurgency theory and practice became “intelligence-driven.”",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/R3UA4P9D,2009-04-01,David A.

Titled ‘Alert Status and Activity in Syria and Egypt as of 051000 Oct. 73’, the document summarized a long list of warning indicators that should have led any experienced person to the conclusion that the two states had completed all the preparations for attack and were on the verge of launching it. Indeed, at this stage, five of out of the six senior analysts of Syrian and Egyptian affairs in AMAN’s Research Division estimated that war was either certain or highly likely.2 But none of AMAN’s political and military consumers was aware of it. For them, the consensus of Israel’s sole intelligence estimate3 was expressed in paragraph 40 of the document, which said:Although the mere taking of an emergency deployment at the Canal front implies, allegedly, warning indicators for an offensive initiative, to the best of our estimate no change took place in Egypt’s estimate of the balance of forces with the IDF.

From 1945 through 1985, 357 attempted coups d’état occurred in the Third World, and 183 succeeded. The high frequency of coups during this period is unsurprising, especially considering the advantageous position of the military during the rapid and destabilizing pace of modernization and decolonization in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Coups d’état were not exclusive to the Third World, however. They also occurred in members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Surprisingly, however, few scholars have explored why these extra-constitutional regime changes were tolerated, or how they were even possible, within NATO.

Intelligence Failure, Conspiracy Theories and the Case of September 11",Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/0268452042000302985,"The study of intelligence is often inward-looking. Scholars focus upon the means of gathering, evaluating, and distributing information with subsequent evaluation of its impact on decision making. Institution-based analysis ignores the role that the intelligence craft plays in the broader social and political context. This is apparent in the case of intelligence failures which reach beyond government to influence public opinion and ultimately the ability of authorities to mobilise support and govern. In the wake of failure, competing elites contest for power with conspiratorial interpretations of events that provide psychological comfort by offering explanations for events, targeting culprits, and fixing blame. This essay considers the intelligence failure of September 11, 2001, and outlines the conspiracy theories of left and right raised in its wake. Among those charged were the usual suspects - Zionists, the anti-Christ, advocates of a New World Order, and members of the military-industrial complex. In response, American government authorities validated their opponents' plot-making by defending themselves with their own cries of conspiracy. Heightened government secrecy, efforts to intensify surveillance, and the rhetoric of fear deepened the intrigue. In such a culture of conspiracy, charges of subversion bring only short-run gain.

This statement elucidates the negative force of cognitive closure on intelligence, as well as bringing attention to the importance of an understanding of the human factor in intelligence production, and its relationship to discourse failure. Intelligence literature after 9/11 has focused on the causes and nature of intelligence failure, though few inquests have conceived intelligence as a deeply cognitive, and therefore mental and moral landscape that needs to be explored in all its complexity. Intelligence operators, like art spectators, perceive reality filtered through all sorts of implicit and explicit ideological prisms, and these ideologies, whether they are political assumptions or social orthodoxies, manifest themselves as cognitive closure, and shape the discourse in intelligence organizations, as well as between these organizations and society at large.

For intelligence, as for other areas of policy, serious intellectual inquiry is the basis for improving the performance of real-world institutions. The volume explores intelligence from an intellectual perspective, not an organizational one. Instead the book identifies themes that run through these applications, such as the lack of comprehensive theories, the unclear relations between providers and users of intelligence, and the predominance of bureaucratic organizations driven by collection.

They often manage large, powerful, unaccountable organisations, which they hold close. But, despite their close relationship with - and reliance upon - intelligence, autocrats also frequently struggle to use it to enhance decision-making and foreign policy, and consequently suffer avoidable intelligence failures. This article argues that Russia?s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is illustrative of this broader, though understudied, pattern of autocratic mismanagement of strategic intelligence. The invasion was both spurred and accompanied by a catastrophic intelligence failure, the responsibility for which rests with Vladimir Putin, the arbiter of a system with limited capacity to offer dispassionate strategic assessments. His failure is characteristic of autocratic regimes assessing foreign developments, including Putin?s Soviet predecessors.

2783,What's the harm?: the ethics of intelligence collection,Thesis,http://hdl.handle.net/2160/8a508bc4-cc47-4910-939c-7affed650bb6,"As the professional practice of intelligence collection adapts to the changing environment of the twenty-first century, many academic experts and intelligence professionals have called for a coherent ethical framework that outlines exactly when, by what means and to what ends intelligence is justified. Recent controversies, including reports of abuse at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, allegations of extraordinary rendition programmes and the ever-increasing pervasiveness of the 'surveillance state', have all raised concerns regarding the role of intelligence in society. As a result, there is increased debate regarding the question of whether or not intelligence collection can be carried out ethically. This thesis will tackle this question by creating an ethical framework specifically designed for intelligence that is capable of outlining under what circumstances, if any, different intelligence collection activities are ethically permissible. This thesis argues that there is a tension presented by intelligence collection between the damage that it can cause and the important, ethical role it can play in the political community. In order to deal with this tension the ethical framework proposed in this thesis is comprised of two parts. The first part is designed to recognise those features of intelligence that might be considered ethically unacceptable by highlighting the 'harm' it can cause. Once the harm is understood, the second part of the ethical framework establishes a set of Just Intelligence Principles that can outline if and when the harms caused are justified. These Just Intelligence Principles are developed by drawing upon the just war tradition and its criteria of just cause, legitimate authority, right intention, last resort, proportionality and discrimination. By placing the harm that intelligence can cause into context with the Just Intelligence Principles it is possible to limit the use of intelligence while recognising the important role it plays in protecting the political community. Once the ethical framework has been established in Chapter One it is then applied to a range of intelligence collection activities in Chapters Two, Three, Four and Five. This thesis will examine three of the most prominent collection disciplines in the field of intelligence studies: imagery intelligence, signals intelligence and human intelligence. By applying the ethical framework established in the beginning of the thesis to these three important intelligence collection disciplines, it is possible to better understand the ethical framework. The main argument of this thesis will be that the most appropriate ethical framework for intelligence collection is one which is able to recognise that intelligence collection does indeed cause harm, but that sometimes this harm is necessary in order to protect the political community.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/N99UTW4A,2011,Ross Bellaby,,,2022-12-30T13:39:56Z,['DVEM4H4W']

The second half of the study explores intelligence developments from the fall of the Diem regime in November 1963 to President Johnson’s decision to take military action against North Vietnam in February 1965. The study suggests that intelligence deficiencies played a significant role in both the failure of counterinsurgency in the first half of the 1960s and in the decision for direct military intervention in 1965.

2795,"Sir Robert Cecil and Elizabethan Intelligencing, 1590-1603",Thesis,http://oro.open.ac.uk/78595/,"Much scholarly attention has been given to the development of Sir Francis Walsingham’s intelligence-gathering network and how it played an important role in Elizabethan foreign and domestic politics during the 1580s, but little has been attempted for the 1590s. This thesis will argue that the practices and methods that Walsingham laid down did not completely dissipate after his death but in fact continued to be adhered to, most notably in the person of Sir Robert Cecil. It was Cecil who, more than any other Elizabethan in high authority, looked to create his own intelligence-gathering network as he foresaw the benefits of doing so. However, this transition was by no means straightforward, and in fact it can be seen as disjointed.

The thesis will also show that the rise of Cecil’s intelligence-gathering network became intertwined with the rise of his political career. It was not until he became principal secretary in July 1596 that the creation of his own network could really proceed apace. The make-up and construction of his intelligence-gathering network will be discussed, as will the backgrounds of the people who worked for Cecil: his secretaries, his agents and message carriers. In sum, it will be shown that Sir Robert Cecil created by 1603 an effective intelligence-gathering network that was put to good use in the final years of Elizabeth’s reign and continued into that of James I.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/24GQT9TL,2021-08-04,Christopher Mains,,,2022-12-28T12:32:53Z,['DS3WDJUS']
2796,Intelligence and British decolonisation: the development of an imperial intelligence system in the late colonial period 1944-1966,Thesis,http://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/intelligence-and-british-decolonisation(373fddc0-f05e-4b91-8306-90171fec3288).html,"This thesis seeks to explain the development of an ‘imperial intelligence system’ connecting Whitehall and the colonies. The system had two roles; to collect information and process it into intelligence for policy and decision making and to provide machinery to coordinate and implement covert action in support of policy. The ‘system’ consisted of parallel information channels; interconnected, coordinated, and directed by committees at various levels. Analysis was mainly conducted in Whitehall departments. The system reflected the split between ‘security’ and ‘foreign’ intelligence and the ‘information gathering’ and ‘covert action’ roles in the British machinery. The system paralleled the British professional intelligence machinery headed by the JIC and this division prevented information from being fully integrated with other consumers in Whitehall. The system was shaped by four major factors: threats; experience; the nature of the administrative system; and the development of professional agenda in both the administration and security organisation (the Security Service and Colonial Police Service) which dictated the points of reform and development over time. Before the Second World War information gathered by ‘police’ and ‘administrators’ was used to manage a colony’s internal politics. The end of ‘colonial isolation’ during the 1930s and 1940s meant colonial problems affected the British state’s international prestige and later its ability to fight the Cold War. To counter this, Whitehall departments sought information to increase their control over colonial affairs, despite the opposition of the Colonial Office which was used to a degree of autonomy. The Colonial Office was more closely coordinated into Whitehall. Colonial and metropolitan intelligence systems were connected and common practices and product formats adopted. Whitehall tried to use ‘counter subversion’ to shape colonial politics. Security intelligence became increasingly important in the last stages of decolonization because, it was the last source of information handed over and consequently it shaped Whitehall’s reactions to events. The machinery also assisted the British to maintain their influence in new states after independence.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GI8USFKS,2015,Gregor Davey,,,2022-12-28T12:31:09Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE']"
2797,"Information, frontiers and barbarians: the role of strategic intelligence in the relations of the late Roman Empire with Persia and northern peoples",Thesis,https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.19021,"Strategic intelligence - that is, information about the activities and affairs of potential enemies relevant to a state's strategic concerns - is an important factor in the foreign relations of any state. This thesis investigates the role of strategic intelligence throughout Roman relations with Sasanian Persia (early 3rd to early 7th century A.D.) and in the empire's relations with northern peoples beyond the Danube, Rhine, and Hadrian's Wall while these remained imperial frontiers during the same period. Two broad questions are addressed. The first concerns the extent to which strategic intelligence moved between the empire and these neighbouring peoples, and its consequent role in their relations. The second concerns the means by which this information moved. Chapters 1 and 4 consider the first question for relations with Persia and with northern peoples respectively. The first chapter argues that strategic intelligence moved between the Roman and Persian empires with a high degree of regularity: neither could mount a major invasion without the other having some foreknowledge, and both frequently undertook aggressive action so as to exploit knowledge of the other's disadvantages. It is therefore argued that strategic intelligence had an important role in determining the pattern of aggression in Roman-Persian relations, but also in limiting the overall level of warfare between them across four centuries. Chapter 4 concludes that while strategic intelligence also traversed the northern frontier, it did so with less regularity than in the east, with the result that relations in the north were less stable. Chapters 2 and 3 consider how strategic intelligence moved between the Roman and Persian empires. Attention is given to the use of embassies and spies in the gathering of intelligence about military preparations and other indicators, but it is argued that such information also made its way informally between the empires as part of the intensive cross-frontier interchange which characterised northern Mesopotamia. Chapter 5 argues that such interchange was less frequent across the northern frontier, and that the more limited degree of state formation among northern peoples (compared with Persia) meant that information gathering through spies and embassies was also less effective. The Conclusion draws together the results of this comparison of east and north, and reflects on the implications of the argument for the debate about continuity of the empire in the east and its demise in the west.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VIEGECKY,1987,A.

2798,Israel and Africa : military and intelligence liaisons,Thesis,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/252040,"For more than three decades, from the mid 1950s to the late 1980s, Israel’s activity in Africa was central to the former’s strategic, security, and foreign polices. Israel was a young, poor, small, and inexperienced country in those years, but it was able to use its advantages to become a major player on the great African continent. Because of a convergence of both Israeli and African interests, the essence of these bilateral relations was covert and focused mainly on the security and intelligence spheres. Israel’s military and intelligence activity in Africa is a remarkable story of a small country’s ability to build on its advantages and reap the benefits. A thorough examination of this important subject has never been conducted before. This research intends to fill the gap. Israel’s African initiative placed it on the front lines of the cold war struggle over the destiny of the continent. At certain times and in particular regions, Israel was almost as involved as either of the superpowers – and sometimes even more so – and it played a decisive role in influencing domestic developments in some countries and in bilateral African relations. Also, Africa’s indisputable value as an intelligence arena gave birth to a manifold of intelligence work carried out there by <i>Mossad</i>. The dissertation makes use of massive documentation, which has never before been published, including inner correspondence of Israeli Intelligence, Military and Diplomatic corps, and many interviews with key officials. The research leads to the conclusion that the intricate history of Israeli involvement in Africa reflects the transformations within Israel’s diplomatic, defence and intelligence decision-making processes. This is true not only in the confinements of the African arena, but also in a broader, world-wide perspective. In other words, the processes of historical transformations within Israel are reflected in the micro-level of Israel’s presence in Africa.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/E3EDFLC4,2007,Ronen Bergman,,,2022-12-28T12:26:31Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

For Iran and the non-Soviet Bloc powers, Iran’s newly established intelligence and national security organisation (SAVAK) had become an entity whose counter-intelligence capabilities were crucial in curtailing the activities of Soviet and Soviet-aligned intelligence officers within Iran. The intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union, the KGB and GRU, were highly active within Iran in both seeking to gather intelligence and to undermine the Pahlavi regime and it was left to the SAVAK’s counter-intelligence directorate to pursue the difficult task of combating these efforts. This Cold War battle extended to Iraq where Iraqi governments were viewed by the SAVAK as being proxies for Soviet interests. As a result of such concerns the SAVAK’s foreign intelligence structure sought not only to gather intelligence but also to directly influence events within Iraq. Iran's counter-intelligence and foreign-intelligence structures therefore played a critical national security role during the Cold War years 1957-1968. This research will firstly explore how the SAVAK’s foreign intelligence activities ultimately led to the establishment and expansion of Iranian intelligence collection and analysis capabilities in its regional sphere of interest. Intelligence theory is also used to examine the SAVAK's counter-intelligence and foreign intelligence structures and operations during the stated period of investigation, together with the influence of Cold War thinking on its activities. The main strands of inquiry in this research will at the outset involve the question of why Iran felt it necessary to establish professional foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence capabilities. The structure and operational methods of these capabilities will then be examined along with the reasons for why the USSR and Iraq were targeted by Iranian foreign intelligence and counter-intelligence. The important relationship between intelligence and policy formulation and execution will also be analysed in this specific period of the Cold War.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/E7F93XM5,2011,Kaveh Kaveh Moravej,,,2022-12-27T23:43:10Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE']"

This inquiry puts forward the idea of a 'Europe of anti-terror intelligence cooperation' to challenge false beliefs and, in particular, two dominant representations of intelligence relationships. Despite the British opt-out from Justice and Home Affairs and ‘Brexit’, it disputes not only the assumption whereby Britain has an ambivalent position towards the European Union as a result of its ‘special relationship’ with the United States but it also debunks the myth of the unbreakable allegiance of British services to the American 'friend'. By contrast, it shows that alliances with European services have long been in development and have formed, over time, a space of relationships which is structured around specific stakes and modalities of action. The contribution of sociology, notably through Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts, is crucial since it breaks with the dominance of rational choice theory and functionalist approaches and puts the role of social actors and their daily 'ways of doing things’ at the core of the inquiry. It is, therefore, by carrying out an ontological and an epistemological rupture with previous studies that this project can shed light on the ‘Europeanness’ of British services.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/RNYSIR7A,2018,Hager Ben Jaffel,,,2022-12-27T23:41:59Z,['TLFN4NAL']

strategy and military capabilities during the Pacific War is a subject that has been
neglected. Using archival material that has been previously unused, this thesis
will examine the manner in which intelligence influenced the British military
establishment's perception of its Japanese adversary. Moreover, it will attempt to
determine the effect that intelligence had on British war plans in the Far Eastern
theaters. Using the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict in July 1937 as the
starting point, the thesis will illustrate the extent to which Britain's
miscalculation of its adversary prior to Japan's declaration of war on the West in
December 1941 was due to the absence of reliable intelligence. In addition to
the obstacles created by the secretive manner in which Japan conducted its
diplomacy and strategic planning, Britain's lack of first-hand experience in
dealing with its adversary prevented its military establishment from grasping the
dangers that could be posed by japan's expansionist moves. The shock created
by Japan's spectacular victories in Southeast Asia following the outbreak of war
in December 1941 was necessary to convince Britain that Japan was in fact both
willing and capable of challenging the West. Furthermore, Britain's reverses
brought home the extent to which its forces in the Far East were inadequate. As
the conflict progressed, the British military establishment used the intelligence
obtained through its encounters with Japan's armed forces in order to obtain an
accurate picture the threat that its enemy could pose, as well as to determine the
most effective means by which the challenges could be overcome. The thesis
will therefore attempt to shed new light on Britain's conduct of its war against
Japan by illustrating the extent to which first-hand combat experience was
necessary in order to enable the military establishment to accurately assess its
enemy, and to devise an effective strategy by which to defeat it.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PN6S9HFX,2002,Douglas Eric Ford,,,2022-12-27T23:40:32Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

From 1941, when the first US intelligence agents arrived in the area, until late 1944, when the Anglo-American covert contingent largely departed to follow the Allied armies on their advance into the Axis heartland, the city served as a regional headquarters in the secret war against fascism. Utilising a comparative approach, this dissertation analyzes the three main geographical areas covered by the Algiers-based secret networks. New archival research and oral testimony is used to illuminate important topics in the field: particularly the history of wartime intelligence in Italy. The discrepancy between the disappointing Anglo-American clandestine campaign in Italy, and the more successful experience in France, is probed. Drawing on these investigations, and ongoing trends in the historiography of intelligence, it comes to the following conclusions on the nature of the secret war. First, the universal application of special operations, regardless of political or military conditions in the target country was ill-judged. Second, the British and American intelligence agencies were engaged in a constant struggle for authority and leadership. A cooperative approach was usually favoured by the stronger power; the weaker party viewed ‘cooperation’ as a euphemism for subordination. Finally, Allied policymakers sometimes ignored or misinterpreted intelligence that did not fit their political priorities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/AFFY2MQL,2005,T.

Part two of the thesis examines how this exclusion elevated the role of overt intelligence as a substitute form of intelligence; ‘the power of the press’ in this context is a very apt term. The enemy and neutral press were acquired, analysed and any relevant intelligence gained was quickly distributed around the various government departments by the FRPS. The key role the FO played in requesting, prioritising, and utilising the information provided by the FRPS Baltic States Section and the FRPS Russian Research Section is also examined. Part two of thesis concludes with a study of the fruits of the FRPS Russian Research Section’s labours and how its work influenced British post-war policy towards the Soviet Union.
Finally part three examines the content of this overt intelligence in two case studies concerning German Economic Policy and Population Policy. Britain’s wartime policy towards the Soviet Union is then described in order to set the work of the FRPS in context.
The thesis is not an attempt to complete a top-to-bottom study of the German occupation of the Baltic states, but rather to present the contemporary British perspective on this occupation, a perspective which was derived almost entirely from overt intelligence.

It stretches from the point when the Soviet Union entered the Second World War as Britain's ally in 1941, to the moment a decade later in 1951, when the Cold War had set in and Moscow was the bitter enemy of the west. Using recently declassified Security Service (MIS) records, it examines how Britain's intelligence services met the massive transition from World War to Cold War. It reveals a variety of subjects previously undocumented in the secondary historical literature, such as MIS's concerns after the Second World War with terrorism emanating from the Middle East. The dissertation is an attempt to rescue intelligence from historical obscurity and place it in its justified position: as a central component in the process of political decision-making in Britain. As well as offering new historical insights, it provides useful lessons for governments and intelligence agencies at the start of the twenty-first century.

The effective collection and management of intelligence by Special Branch dominates this paradigm. However, the intelligence architecture during Emergency was much more complicated than the simple Special Branch-Army nexus upon which existing studies focus. Other components of the intelligence included the Malayan Security Service (MSS), Security Intelligence Far East (SIFE), the Joint Intelligence Committee / Far East (JIC/FE), the Royal Air Force (RAF), the Army, and the mainstream police. Each component adapted to the challenge of insurgency in different ways – the civilian elements faring far worse than the military. Britain struggled to adapt to the post-war intelligence challenges in the Far East. Key intelligence components and capabilities were constituted in haste with overlapping and ambiguous remits. Consequently, there was bitter infighting at a number of levels, particularly between the various civilian intelligence agencies. In contrast, the Army and RAF demonstrated an instinctive ability to work in a ‘joint’ environment from the very beginning of the Emergency. In particular, the RAF took a leading role in creating a joint theatre-level intelligence apparatus which included establishment of a Joint Operations Room in Kuala Lumpur and the Joint Intelligence Photographic Intelligence Committee / Far East. However, the military were unable to provide the comprehensive human intelligence or strategic leadership necessary to make the broader apparatus effective. This could only come once the apparatus led by the civil agencies – chiefly the uniformed police as well as Special Branch – had learnt to adapt to the demands of waging a counter-insurgency campaign. Given that the British intelligence organisations had learnt to function in a joint manner during the Second World War, it is remarkable how much had apparently been forgotten in the three years preceding the outbreak of the Communist 1 AIR 20/7777, Report on the Emergency in Malaya, from April 1950 to November 1951, by Sir Harold Briggs. insurgency in Malaya and how long it took to create an effective method of coordinating intelligence during subsequent Emergency.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/6MDMCWFP,2016,Roger Christopher Arditti,,,2022-12-27T23:24:04Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE']"

The former had an incentive to develop Pan-Islamism as an element of the 'special feature' policy they were employing to assist in securing victory in the First World War. This was a policy 'to foster and encourage any movements of unrest and sedition', including the Pan-Islamic movement, 'directed against the British Empire'.1 The latter, who, due to the military needs of the European empires, had been forced to converge in East Africa in a manner never previously seen, conversed about Pan-Islamism amongst themselves. Officials of the British Empire identified that Pan-Islamism had manifested itself into two threats: Pan-Islamic unity and the use of the machinery developed by Pan-Islamism by those who advocated for Pan-Africanism. The developing counter-intelligence arm of the British imperial intelligence establishment worked to counter these threats. This development resulted in the institution of the East African Intelligence Centre in 1917. They were successful: to a point. The British Empire in East Africa was not destroyed by Pan-Islamism during the First World War. But they were unable to remove the threat posed by Pan-Islamism from the East African region. In the early Twentieth Century the United Kingdom had revolutionised its intelligence establishment, but it had failed to realise that counter-intelligence in the British Empire had not been accounted for. Consequently, the British Empire was forced to institute a colonial counter-intelligence establishment during the hostilities of the Great War.

More specifically, it examines the counter-subversive policies and measures conducted by the British Intelligence and Security Services, and Britain’s secret propaganda apparatus, the Information Research Department (IRD) of the Foreign Office, in Middle Eastern countries, such as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iran, during the period between 1949 and 1963. This thesis is also about intelligence liaison – the relationship between British Intelligence and Security Services and their Middle Eastern counterparts. This thesis argues that the British Empire declined between 1949 and 1963; in this, intelligence was understood by British policymakers as a tool to maintain British influence and preserve British strategic and economic interests in the Middle East. The imperial drive derived from a mixture of strategic and economic interests in the region but it was Britain’s anti-Communist attitudes which were shared with Middle Eastern governments. This was the context in which intelligence liaison was established between Britain and Middle Eastern states on the basis of their common interests. Although Britain’s anti-Communist policy contributed to preventing the spread of Communist movements in the region, it sought to strengthen the repressive capability of Middle Eastern governments which undermined their own political position by their repressiveness. An unintended consequence was that the Middle Eastern governments conducted counter-subversion not only against Communists, but also their own people. This thesis concludes that Britain’s anti-Communist policy sustained British influence and British interests in the region in the short term, but failed to sustain its objectives in the long term.

2825,'Secret towns': British intelligence in Asia during the Cold War,Thesis,http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/81565/,"The British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) remains one of the most obscure and elusive government agencies. Despite its rich and often tangled past, the SIS withstood various challenges in the twentieth century to become a vital instrument in Britain’s foreign policy, offering both traditional intelligence gathering, and a covert action capability. Despite recent revelations about its Cold War history, knowledge about this organisation is uneven at best, and this is particularly so in Asia. Despite Britain’s imperial history, which anchored informal intelligence gathering networks on a global scale, SIS’s presence in Asia is largely undiscovered. This thesis asks why this lacuna exists in SIS’s history; what was SIS activity in this region during the Cold War? Moreover, what was the value of this activity? Utilising a primarily archival methodology, this thesis sheds light on British intelligence activity in Hong Kong, Beijing, and Hanoi in the late 1960s. The strategic aims are twofold. Firstly, it explores the kinds of intelligence gathered, and the difficulties encountered from operating within the heart of a secure communist state in order to gauge an ‘enemy society’. In doing so, it challenges conventional definitions of intelligence, pointing to the notion of a dual identity diplomat-intelligence officer, that provided alternative means of acquiring intelligence within denied areas. In this way, it opens a window into a new dimension of SIS history, and, by extension, GCHQ, both of whom operated from the grey space between diplomacy and intelligence. Secondly, it examines this intelligence through the broader framework of the Anglo-American Special Relationship, given that these three case study countries were areas where the SIS operated, but where the CIA encountered real hindrances due to a lack of diplomatic premises. By tracing the path of British intelligence material, and analysing its reception by its American audience, it ultimately assesses the value of such intelligence. It argues that the granular detail afforded, and the insight on broader strategic relationships it provided, inverted the Special Relationship, rendering Britain a valued partner when it came to intelligence collection in this region and off-setting imbalances elsewhere.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/T7BJLEIQ,2016,Nikita Shah,,,2022-12-27T23:15:20Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE']"

battlefield, and he advised commanders to rely on their intuition instead. It is a
paradox of the Second World War that when, as never before, an abundance of
intelligence was available to Allied commanders, Clausewitz's dictums still
influenced some of their operational decisions. This thesis explores this duality,
and how it influenced the relationship between intelligence and command at the
operational level of war during the conflict. It does so through the medium of the
British Army, in particular Eighth Army's operational performance - under
Bernard Montgomery, Oliver Leese and Richard McCreery - at defining
moments of the Italian campaign.
The thesis demonstrates the ambiguity present within the British Army's
doctrinal attitude towards intelligence at the operational level, which was
reflected in the
.
tardiness with which intelligence was incorporated into the
army's operational machinery during the first half of the war. That this was
eventually achieved was illustrated by the general efficacy of Eighth Army's
intelligence organisation in Italy, and the viability of its intelligence product.
Nevertheless, the peculiarities of the Italian theatre reduced the productiveness
of the chief sources of intelligence, and created occasional, but critical, gaps in
the intelligence picture. This only partially explains, however, why Eighth Army's
operational performance in Italy was punctuated by intelligence failure. Under
Montgomery and Leese, intelligence was merely an ancillary, and often
sidelined, tenet of their operational technique, and it was only under McCreery
that Eighth Army practised intelligence-led warfare. These findings seriously
question the historiographical belief that, by the second half of the war, the
British Army had fully and unconditionally incorporated intelligence into its
operational considerations, and that commanders were willing to act upon it and
fashion their operational methods according to its dictates.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ICRDUXTC,2005,Kevin Leslie Jones,,,2022-12-27T23:07:25Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

This is compared to the portrayals of the British Intelligence Services provided by key avenues of information, namely, the Government, academia, news journalism and popular culture. Whilst all the avenues provide an overall positive portrayal of the British Intelligence Services, with a consistent emphasis upon acting legally and ethically, due to the diversity of these avenues, each provides a subtly different depiction of the British Intelligence Services. Due to the pervasiveness of secrecy surrounding the British Intelligence Services, these avenues are in an influential position of informing the public domain about the intelligence realm.

Churchill proves to have been a voracious reader of diplomatic intercepts from 1941-44, and used them as part of his communication with the Foreign Office. This thesis establishes the value of these intercepts (particularly those Turkey- sourced) in supplying Churchill and the Foreign Office with authentic information on neutrals' response to the war in Europe, and analyses the way Churchill used them. Turkey was seen by both sides to be the most important neutral power and therefore constitutes the case study for this analysis. The thesis answers the question 'why did Turkey interest Churchill.' by tracing his involvement with diplomatic intercepts back to 1914, and then revealing how the Government Code and Cipher School (GCCS) was empowered to continue monitoring such traffic until 1939, when 'Station X' was established at Bletchley Park (BP). Following two chapters that trace the interwar work of GCCS on the secret diplomatic traffic of most major powers and outline Turkey's place amongst those powers, the thesis concentrates on four events or processes in which Churchill's use of diplomatic messages played a part in determining his wartime policy, which was sometimes at odds with that of the Foreign Office. Chapter four answers the question what use did Churchill and the Foreign Office make of bjs to persuade Turkey to join the Allies between 1940 and 1942. Chapter five offers a new explanation of why the Adana conference of January 1943 produced little change in Turkish foreign policy. Chapter six explains the Dodecanese defeat of 1943 in the light of the signals intelligence Churchill was reading. Chapter seven shows the results at GCCS in London of the theft of secret Foreign Office papers in Ankara from November 1943: whether actual bjs were included in these papers; how they were received in Berlin and subsequently in Berne, Washington and London; and how they led to a breakthrough in reading the German diplomatic cipher, too late to be useful to Churchill. The thesis concludes by emphasising the personalised nature of wartime diplomacy and re-iterates the reasons why Churchill and the Foreign Office attached such importance to their 'Most Secret Sources', though their availability to historians requires little change to the record.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GGFYTI6V,1997,Robin Denniston,,,2022-12-27T22:44:32Z,"['T92JK7A5', '4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

Cultural representations of spies are a particularly rich source of analysis of the three themes given the character of the profession, which has captured the public imagination, but about which information in the public domain is erratic and selective. The primary source base includes 89 British novels and 53 films (both cinema and television), cartoons and newspaper articles. A formalist approach to these sources is complemented by cultural materialism in order to work closely with the texts while emphasising the importance of the political and social contexts in which these sources were produced and consumed. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first identifies contrasting typologies of masculinities and femininities in popular representations. The spectrums of masculinity depend upon bisecting axes: the maverick/organisation spectrum is determined by the spy's role in and relationship to the organisation; the peacock/chameleon spectrum is determined by visibility and tradecraft and is more responsive to social change than the former category. Women fall on a singular spectrum ranging from Angel to Patriot to Whore. While these three categories are remarkably consistent over time, by the end of the period under investigation the new category of the Professional emerges who blends the three. The second section is thematic and maps these gender constructions on to two dominant themes of popular representations of espionage: betrayal and moral complexity. Part two explores the cultural circuit between the public and fictional representation of spies and the implicit and explicit explorations of gender identities thus generated in a period marked by major public scandals in the espionage world. The thesis concludes that although this is a genre which is little constrained by public knowledge of the world it depicts, it is nonetheless heavily constrained by societal norms and deeply revealing of gender roles, particularly masculine ones.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IXQI672F,2015,Kirsten Ann Smith,,,2022-12-27T22:43:40Z,['NWAKWPT7']
2834,The military career of General Sir Henry Brackenbury 1856-1904,Thesis,https://dora.dmu.ac.uk/handle/2086/2425,"This thesis deals with a largely forgotten soldier, writer and administrator of the mid  
to late Victorian era. General Sir Henry Brackenbury’s career covered some forty- 
eight years. He was either directly involved in or was witness to all the major events  
of the British Army during this period, from the Crimean War to the South African  
War. His career encompassed an era of reform that saw the army move away from the  
military system of the Napoleonic Wars and the gradual establishment of the  
system with which the British Army would take the field in 1914.  
 
The aim of this thesis is to look at the military career of Sir Henry Brackenbury,  
rather than be a biography of the man. However his literary career, personal life and  
financial circumstances are intrinsically linked to his life as a soldier. What this shows  
is a highly intelligent soldier, perhaps the first of a new bread of so-called ‘Scientific  
Soldiers’, men who studied and thought about their profession.  
 
Apart from a considerable, and important, amount of active service overseas,  
Brackenbury held three key administrative positions, which were the highlight of his  
army service and allowed his talents to come to the fore. As Head of the Intelligence  
Branch at the War Office, Military Member of the Council of the Governor General  
of India, and Director General of the Ordnance, he ended his long career with  
powerful and important positions that brought much praise. Indeed his contemporaries considered him to be the most effective holder of these posts.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PGISAQHG,2009,Christopher Brice,,,2022-12-27T22:40:07Z,"['9DTPTK46', '4BH8AYZE']"

As the first full length academic study of the BBC Monitoring Service, this thesis seeks to examine one of the earliest historic attempts to systematically manage and exploit publicly available, open source information for intelligence purposes. It utilises the Imperial War Museum’s rarely used collection of BBC Monitoring transcripts, in conjunction with traditional archival sources and oral interviews, to trace the origins, processes and institutional structure developed by the Monitoring Service during its formative years. This study further assesses the collection priorities of BBC Monitoring during World War Two, traces the historic flow of monitored material around the wartime Government and BBC, and establishes the institutional role of BBCM in the conduct of Britain’s war effort. Three case study chapters, focusing on the outbreak of war, Dunkirk and D-Day, particularly assess the process and detailed collection priorities of the Monitoring Service during key events throughout the war. This study thus makes a contribution to the historic picture of British intelligence during World War Two, and is bound to encourage future study of the BBC Monitoring Service and its archives. Overall, the BBC Monitoring Service is judged a historic success story. This thesis argues that this success can be attributed to three key qualities developed during the wartime period: trust, breadth, and adaptability. The organisation established a relationship of trust with the Government; developed and maintained a remarkable breadth of broadcast coverage; and showed a constant ability to adapt to both customer demands and changing strategic priorities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/X3HB5RND,2013,Laura Marie Johnson,,,2022-12-27T22:38:18Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"
2836,"The Palestine Exploration Fund, 1865-1914",Thesis,http://hdl.handle.net/2381/35576,"Founded in 1865, the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF) was for the first 20 years of its existence both the principal British exploration society in the Holy Land and a surveying organisation which was heavily dependent upon the work of and support of the Royal Engineers. From 1865 to 1886 PEF functioned as an independent organisation dependent for its work and existence upon the intelligence department of the War Office. Employing Royal Engineers, men and officers, the Fund surveyed western and eastern Palestine, Sinai, and completed a geographical survey around the Dead Sea. Its surveyors included Charles Wilson (later Sir Charles Wilson), Charles Warren (later Sir Charles Warren), Claude Conder and H. H. Kitchener (later Lord Kitchener), and its supporters and organisers included many notable men of the day. The survey operation linked closely with the need for a full map of the Holy Land area in order to protect and police the eastern hinterland to the Suez Canal. After 1890 the PEF became an archaeological organisation employing William Flinders Petrie (1891), Frederick Jones Bliss (1891-1900), R. A. Macalister (1900-09) and lastly Duncan Mackenzie (1910-1912). From 1913 to 1914 the PEF reverted to its former role of intelligence gathering for the War Office and employed Leonard Woolley and T. E. Lawrence as archaeologists and as a cover for Royal Engineers under Captain Newcombe who surveyed the Wilderness of Zin area. After 1918 the British Mandate in Palestine rendered such uses of the PEF obsolete. This thesis examines the composition of the PEF, its foundation, the involvement of the military intelligence departments with PEF, its financial basis and its relationship to the British involvement in the Middle East. It does not examine the PEF's role in archaeological history, but concentrates upon its work as a Victorian imperial institution.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/7QPPJR4E,1996,John James Moscrop,,,2022-12-27T22:36:34Z,"['9DTPTK46', '4BH8AYZE']"
2837,MI9's escape and evasion mapping programme 1939-1945,Thesis,http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/3553,"This thesis examines the programme of mapping produced on silk, and other fabric, by MI9 to facilitate the escape and evasion of British military personnel during World War II. It considers the creation of MI9 in December 1939, the rationale for the new military intelligence branch and the context of the history of military mapping on silk. The map production programme is described, together with its progress and the challenges faced. The various groups of maps are identified and described, together with the source maps on which they were based. This description is developed in nine appendices produced as an integral part of the research to provide a comprehensive carto-bibliography of the 234 individual maps which have been identified. Location details of extant copies in British map collections are also provided. The ingenious methods of smuggling the maps into the camps, with other escape aids, in apparently innocuous leisure items are described. The maps were then copied and reproduced to support the escapes. Coded correspondence with the camps is discussed, and a successful deciphering of some of that correspondence is provided. The implications for the escape and evasion programme were considerable, but so too were the implications of the passage of intelligence from the camps to aid the war effort, a factor apparently largely overlooked in previous studies of the wartime role of the intelligence branches. Three case studies are provided to demonstrate the role and importance of the contribution made by the maps to the escape and evasion programme. The conclusion assesses the significance of this little known episode in British historical cartography of the twentieth century which essentially provides the latest chapter in the story of military mapping on silk, and other fabric, through the ages.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/E25GVRFX,2014,Barbara A.

The importance of this topic was highlighted by revelations in 2003 and 2005 concerning two senior republicans who had both been working for British intelligence for decades. The uncovering of these two senior spies created intense debate within the media and Irish republican community as to whether the IRA ended its military campaign largely because of significant infiltration. Yet, surprisingly, there has been no dedicated academic study of the impact of informers and agents upon the IRA. A few academics have briefly considered this topic in recent monographs and journal articles. Whilst acknowledging other important factors, they argue that intelligence successes against the IRA played a crucial role in influencing that organization to end its military campaign in 1998. This first in-depth study of the influence of informers and agents on IRA and British strategies during the Troubles cross-references new extensive interview material alongside memoirs from various Troubles participants. Its central argument is that the elusive nature of many rural IRA units, its cellular structure in Belfast, and the isolation of the IRA leadership prevented the organization from being damaged to any considerable extent by spies. In fact, the IRA’s resilience was a key factor encouraging the British government to try to include republicans in political settlements in 1972, 1975 and the 1990s. The IRA’s military strength also points towards the prominence of political factors in persuading republicans to call a ceasefire by 1994. The role of spies in Northern Ireland and the circumstances in which the state permitted negotiations with the IRA are key considerations for those interested in other small-scale conflicts.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/EHXCMUIZ,2015,Thomas Daniel Melchizadek Leahy,,,2022-12-27T22:35:27Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE', 'TLFN4NAL']"

The question of control over war-ravaged, but strategically significant Germany was critical to the security of Europe. As such, Germany and Berlin in particular, became the most important Cold War battleground in Europe. By combining recently released JIC archives with both existing research on intelligence, foreign and defence policy and records from the other government departments, this research adds to the understanding of one of the central themes of the Cold War. It reveals how ministers, senior officials and military officers made use of the assessmentps roduced by the JIC in formulating their policies towards Germany and the developing threat from the Soviet Union and its allies. This research takes a chronological approach, in order to trace both the development of policy and of the role of the JIC within central government. It explores the major crises of the period: the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948, the riots in East Berlin of June 1953 and the 1958-61 Berlin Crisis. Away from these crises, the thesis examines the picture that the JIC painted of Soviet intentions and capabilities in Eastern Germany and of the development of the two German nations. It also looks at the JIC's contribution to British attitudes towards German rearmament. The developing role of the intelligence apparatus, both within central government and in Germany is a major theme running through the thesis. By improving its sources, its product and its administration, the JIC ensured that it became an essential tool for successive governments, and within Whitehall, became the interface between intelligence and policy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GQVXA2UV,2009,Simon Case,,,2022-12-27T22:34:13Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE', 'CK5MNYPQ']"

of the Spanish Civil War is the role of Soviet intelligence services. Every scholar who tries to
tackle this problem will soon find out how notoriously hard it is to ensure accuracy, truth and
objectivity in writing about secret intelligence and counterintelligence. There the whole
purpose of governments is not to document but to hide the facts, and there, too, witnesses are
unlikely to know the full truth underlying even the events in which they personally
participated. As a result, the interpretation of these secret doings can quickly coagulate in
false patterns. Writers deprived of access to fresh facts, original documents and ability to
professionally assess the information tend to copy what other have written although that may
be largely guesswork, misinformation and speculation. Any single surviving fragmentary
detail gains value because no other is recorded, even though it may stem from ignorance or
partisanship, and by repetition it gains credibility and becomes history. In recent times, there
has been a growth of interest to this particular topic due, first of all, to the efforts of the
imminent British intelligence historian Professor Christopher Andrew, and because more and
more original documents became available to researchers. There are, nonetheless, still major
gaps in our knowledge of wartime intelligence in what concerns Soviet operations on the
Republican territory and outside it. Who were the people sent by the Soviet government?
What was their mission brief and how they carried out orders? What was their influence, if
any, on the outcome of the war? How did secret intelligence influence Stalin's decisions in
relation to Spain at various periods of the conflict? This work cannot hope to cover the vast
programme of research on intelligence and the war history or international relations albeit in a
very short period of three years (1936-39), but it seeks to give scholars, researchers and
students of intelligence better access to primary sources from many archives, oral histories,
memoirs, books and articles in several languages otherwise little known, totally unknown or
very hard to acquire. This previously unknown information may help the historian to make
different conclusions from what seemed an established fact, was misinterpreted or

2841,Britain's exploitation of Occupied Germany for scientific and technical intelligence on the Soviet Union,Thesis,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/226719,"At the beginning of the Cold War, the gathering of intelligence on the Soviet Union's 
current and future military capability seemed a near-impossibility. Soviet high-level 
communications were secure against decryption. Agent networks in the USSR were 
very difficult to establish and of uncertain reliability. Aerial reconnaissance of warrelated 
targets in the Soviet Union was risky and could only be occasional. But 
valuable intelligence was gathered in the years 1945-55 on the USSR's frantic arms 
build-up, thanks to its policy towards Germans and their country. Its exploitation of 
Germans and its Zone of Germany in its war-related research and development and 
the reconstruction of its war-related industries gave British Intelligence penetrable 
targets in the Soviet Zone and gave great numbers of Germans sought-after 
information on the USSR itself. The ease of recruiting age nts in East Germany and 
the flight (including enticed defections) of refugees from it allowed research and 
development projects and uranium.-mining operations there to be penetrated. 
Intelligence of Soviet weapons development and of the quality of Soviet military 
technology was obtained. The mass interrogation of prisoners-of-war returned by the 
Soviets to the British Occupation Zone in the late 1940s yielded a wealth of valuable 
information on war-related construction and the locations of numerous intelligence 
targets in the Soviet Union: most importantly, those of atomic and chemical plants, 
aircraft and aero-engine factories, airfields, rocket development centres and other 
installations. When, in the period 1949-58, some 3,000 deported German scientists , 
engineers and technicians were sent back to their homeland from the USSR, 
promising sources among them were enticed West and interrogated for their 
knowledge of the Soviets' research and development projects. The cream of the 
information they provided was crucial intelligence on the locations of atomic plants 
and laboratories and uranium deposits; useful information on structural weaknesses in 
the Soviet system of scientific and economic management; expert (if out-of-date) 
assessments of the quality of Soviet accomplishments in atomic science, electronics 
and other fields; and well-informed indications as to possible lines of development in 
guided missile and aircraft design. One Soviet scientific defector in Germany 
provided similar information which influenced British perceptions of the Soviet 
Union's scientific potential and missile development plans. Refugees entering the 
British Zone from East Germany, intercepted letters and monitored 
telecommunications, informal contacts and, of course, secret agents all made 
significant contributions to the gathering of scientific and technical intelligence in 
Germany too. The British passed to the Americans much of the intelligence they 
acquired in Germany and the installations identified and located by German sources 
were overtlown by spyplanes in the 1950s and particularly by U-2s in the latter half 
of-the decade. Priceless information was obtained, which establi shed that the USSR's 
war-related scientific research and development and its actual military capability were 
both inferior to those of the West. Thus the Germans enabled Soviet security to be 
deeply penetrated and helped to stabilize the Cold War. They are the missing link 
between Ultra and the U-2.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HVS8MZQP,1999-01-26,John Paul Maddrell,,,2022-12-27T22:32:08Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE']"

passing intelligence about the top secret British and American atomic 
programmes to representatives of Soviet intelligence organisations. The 
information that they provided made a significant impact upon Soviet atomic 
research, allowing the USSR's scientists to copy the technologies developed 
by the Manhattan Engineering District (MED), and accelerating the arrival of 
the Soviet atomic bomb by at least a year. 
This dissertation examines the various interactions between these Atom 
Spies and the counter-intelligence organisations in Britain and the United 
States, using a comparative framework. The first chapter examines how 
these individuals were cleared to work on top secret atomic research and 
draws broader conclusions about the security policies employed in each 
country. Moving into the postwar period, the second chapter involves 
discussion of how the defection of Soviet cipher clerk lgor Gouzenko and the 
intensification of the Cold War affected both atomic security and collaboration 
between Britain and the United States. The middle section analyses counterespionage 
operations against the Atom Spies in Britain and America, 
emphasising the role of Signals Intelligence and comparing the investigative 
strategies employed by MI5 and the FBI. The penultimate chapter 
investigates the effect of the Atom Spy cases on atomic security, and includes 
a detailed examination of the case of Bruno Pontecorvo, a British-based 
atomic scientist who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950. Lastly, some of the 
broader consequences of the Atom Spy cases are discussed; as shall 
emerge, the exposure of the Atom Spies played a major role in the postwar 
evolution of both the atomic and intelligence relationship between Britain and 
the United States, as well as contributing to the American debate over the 
need to develop a Hydrogen bomb.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BCKBREWW,2008-05-20,Timothy Samuel Gibbs,,,2022-12-27T22:27:16Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE', 'RHJFPRAI', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

institutional, organisational, personnel, operational, methodological
and technical aspects of naval intelligence work, the developmental
aspects of its history from 1880 to 1945. By analysing specific naval
operations and discussing the strategic and tactical ramifications of
intelligence it seeks to throw light on the impact of intelligence on
naval warfare in this period. In so doing it reveals the place of
intelligence in the general naval history of the period. It is not a
definitive history, but rather a discursive analysis of those aspects
considered the most important.
In the pre-1914 era the N.I.D. was the heart of the
emergent Naval Staff, involved in strategic planning at the highest
level. World War I brought the need for an operational intelligence
organisation, with the priority of locating, identifying, and deducing
the intentions of major German units. Experience in war revealed
the necessity for a clear definition of the relationship between the
Operations Division and the N.I.D. The use of radio intelligence
and cryptanalysis gave N.I.D. great operational successes and
Admiral Hall the opportunity to involve N.I.D. in political issues.The latter led to the review of N.I.D.'s role post 1918 and, in part,
its run-down. The inter-war period witnessed N.I.D.'s decline
as the most dynamic and influential Naval Staff department. Until
the foundation of O.I.C. and the coming of war N.I.D. was a backwater.
World War It witnessed a re-vitalisation, a more structured
and tightly controlled N.I.D., and the D.N.I.. as an important
echelon of the C.O.S. and J.LC. organisations. N.I.D. regained
its previous supremacy and was instrumental in the process towards
intelligence integration at the end of World War U. It scored great
operational successes.

paramount in the naval organisation and critical to the interests
of the State. Its maintenance was contingent upon variables which,

During the war, Churchill embarked on a secretive and ambitious effort to reorganize the Middle East under British hegemony. In order to create a Jewish State and consolidate British control, he opted to support Arab dreams for a Greater Syria which would include the French Levant. Churchill knew that British agents, led by Spears, were conducting a campaign of systematic subversion to oust France from the region. He permitted this operation despite knowing that de Gaulle had evidence on it and despite what it was doing to Anglo-French relations. Eden disagreed with this policy. Intelligence material reveals that he opened a secret channel to de Gaulle and orchestrated a “manoeuvre” to regain control of British grand strategy.

2847,"Sir Basil Thomson and the Directorate of Intelligence : a British experiment in 'high policing', 1919-1921",Thesis,http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/19235,"Within current British Intelligence literature, there is an absence of any detailed examination of the Directorate of Intelligence (DoI), led by Sir Basil Thomson, a policeman. The DoI was created mostly from the Metropolitan Police Special Branch in 1919 by Cabinet decision, primarily to counter post-Great War Bolshevik inspired activism. It became the first civilian domestic Intelligence organisation in Britain, heralding the formalisation of 'high policing', despite the natural British dislike of such 'Continental' practices. This research, utilising traditional historical archival methods, is largely underpinned by Brodeur's 'high/low' policing theory. Firstly, the original English aversion to 'Continental' policing practices is explained with reference to the evolution of the French Police in the early nineteenth century. This is set against the backdrop of natural liberties enjoyed in England. Specifically, it was the suppressive 'high policing' under Joseph Fouché, Napoleon's Minister of Police that was of concern. This was an important factor in preventing the inclusion of such practices when the Metropolitan Police and Provincial Forces were formed. Secondly, in examining the DoI, it is argued that rather than the military, the police were given the domestic Intelligence function for constitutional reasons. Thomson's weekly reports to the Cabinet provide insight into how he organised the DoI to execute its mandate. Three examples are detailed to show its work: the 1919 Police Strike, the Nationalist insurgency in Ireland and associated violence on the mainland as well as counter-Bolshevik propaganda. Thirdly, negative accepted wisdoms in literature regarding Thomson are challenged, showing that despite the DoI's sudden abolition in 1921, it had been efficient and had provided valuable intelligence to government. An aberrant recommendation by the 1921 Secret Service Committee led to the DoI's abrupt termination by Prime Minister Lloyd George. Efficiency was the reason given for his decision, without Cabinet consultation, when the prevailing view among some Parliamentarians was that that the organisation was too 'Continental' in its work, something that was unacceptable with the lessening of the post-war crises.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BH7NCQM5,2019,Mohamed Hanif Majothi,,,2022-12-27T22:20:17Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'MP7FJ9UA']"
2848,"British Intelligence Services in Greece, 1940 - 1947",Thesis,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/297314,"This dissertation seeks to address two key themes, drawing on archives in Britain, the United States, and Greece. Firstly, it examines the impact of British Intelligence on the Greek war effort, resistance to Axis occupation, and the period after liberation, by examining the changing role of intelligence in each period. During the early part of the war, the Intelligence Services, and in particular the newly founded Special Operations Executive, sought to achieve their aim of stoking resistance in Greece to help the British war effort through a number of operations. The failure of these operations, however, would have a lasting impact on their future work in Greece. After the stunning success of SOE Operation ‘Harling’, British officials in Cairo and London increasingly fostered guerrilla warfare, making their mission in Greece extremely complex. This was particularly true of SOE, which now entered the hazardous world of guerrilla politics even as it was now serving an equally important political and diplomatic role. While relations between the British and EAM (the communist-led National Liberation Front) had initially been cordial, relations soured as the war progressed and post-war ambitions became more pressing. Eventually, the understanding between the two sides broke down completely and, only a few months after the liberation of Greece, the British government was in open conflict with the guerrillas of EAM. This leads on to the second key theme of the dissertation: the ramifications of the involvement of British Intelligence on the Greek Civil War, and in particular the effect of the dual policy followed by the British in Greece, trying to achieve what proved to be mutually exclusive military and political aims. It will also seek to elucidate whether British involvement in Greece helped to exacerbate the conditions in Greece which led to Civil War, an ongoing topic of scholarly and public controversy.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ALLPSAJA,2019-10-26,Constantine Capsaskis,,,2022-12-27T19:40:00Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"
2849,British intelligence and American neutrality during the First World War,Thesis,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/265571,"This PhD examines the role of British intelligence in Anglo-American relations during the period of American neutrality in the First \Vorld \Var. Unbeknownst to the Americans, British intelligence began to intercept and decrypt virtually all American diplomatic telegrams between Washington and U.S. diplomatic outposts throughout Europe. Although several studies of Anglo-American relations in this period exist, none consider British intelligence's role. Providing an analysis of the relevant cod.es and cryptographical developments during the war, the thesis traces British intelligence's progress in deciphering these various diplomatic codes and offers an analysis of the distribution and use of this intelligence material. Through an exploration of this intelligence aspect, this thesis challenges existing interpretations of British and American policy in this period. A crucial conflict at the heart of British policy-one missed by previous historians-existed over the importance of the United States. Presaging America's international role later in the twentieth centu1y, many of Britain's leaders came to seriously doubt that, without the United States, the war remained winnable at all. Yet these officials contended with a second, powerful faction that remained wedded to outmoded ideas of America's limited relevance on the global stage and that refused to accept the existence of practical limits to British power. This conflict play~ out in several areas of British policy-over diplomatic, military, financial, and political affairs. Intelligence, however, provea a favoured weapon. Intercepted communications, sometimes ripped from their context, caused serious but spurious paranoia that the Americans were collaborating with Germany. Previous scholars, however, by ignoring the weapon, have failed to see the battle. Until it entered the war, American policymakers worked t:u:elessly to achieve a peaceful settlement. Previous historians have entirely dismissed the significance of these efforts, casting them as well-intentioned but futile. In reality, however, those British leaders who understood Britain's dependence on the United States tended to favour these proposals as a useful way of ending an unwinnable war that was bleeding the country d17- This PhD makes a significant contribution to the history of British intelligence, British policy, and American diplomacy during the period of American neutrality during the First World War.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/QIAF56RE,2014-01-07,Daniel Richard Larsen,,,2022-12-27T19:39:09Z,"['BNPYHVD4', '4BH8AYZE']"

concentrates on the close connection between the British and Spanish gathering of
intelligence and the military decisions adopted in London and Madrid during the
war. The ultimate purpose of this study is to put this war in a broader context and
make a contribution to understand the development of the state in eighteenth
century Europe.
The first part of this study analyses the structure and functioning of the several
British and Spanish Intelligence Networks, i.e. diplomatic and political support to
these networks, expenditures, flowing of intelligence, messengers, agents,
collaborators and counter intelligence. This part consists of two chapters, as
follows: (a) the British Intelligence System and (b) the Spanish Intelligence
System.
The second part of the study explores the connection between the gathering of
intelligence and decision-making in Madrid and London. However, the study of
the use of intelligence can be problematic. This is because neither on the British
nor the Spanish side are there official cabinet records for this period that could
directly link one process with the other. In an attempt to solve this difficulty it has
been decided to study the connection through four case studies. Each of them will
concentrate on one of the military expeditions that Britain and Spain carried out or
planned during the war.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/QTLKZVXD,2009-07,I. Rivas Ibáñez,,,2022-12-25T00:56:54Z,"['DS3WDJUS', '4BH8AYZE']"

Many approaches that address InT assume that these are pathological behaviors, perpetrated by misanthropic ‘malicious insiders’. We present a novel interdisciplinary framework (Multiple Approach Paths to Insider Threat, or MAP-IT) that emphasizes the importance of both individual motivation and social context. Rather than assuming InTs reflect a homogenous ill-intentioned group of individuals that deviate from organizational norms, we consider the importance of general social psychological and personality factors for detecting and responding to InT, especially within the Western intelligence and security context. MAP-IT is based on the premise that InTs can be separated into three motivational pathways (intentional, unintentional, or ambivalent) and that the intentional pathway can be further subdivided into prosocial, asocial, and antisocial motivation.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/A3XQX6GU,2022/8/2,"Jordan Richard Schoenherr, Kristoffer Lilja-Lolax, David Gioe",,Counter-Insider Threat Research and Practice,2022-12-21T13:45:02Z,"['RHJFPRAI', '8F9EJ6CT']"

The focus of American foreign policy and national security on counterterrorism efforts in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks further shaped the dynamic between diplomats and intelligence officers in the field as well as their respective roles. The tension between diplomacy and covert action as policy-implementing tools was largely resolved to the benefit of the latter. Consequently, a new status quo emerged. Intelligence officers took a leading role in policy-implementation efforts through covert action, whilst the role of diplomats in the field evolved in line with counterterrorism-driven foreign policy and national security needs.

Through a detailed examination of the relevant primary sources – including aerial photography recently released to the National Collection of Aerial Photography in Edinburgh - this book investigates the role of British photographic interpretation in the hunt for German V-weapons during Operation Crossbow. In so doing, it provides a wealth of information on such matters as the wartime development of photographic interpretation, the techniques used by the interpreters, the personalities involved, the significance of photographic intelligence to the operation, and the wider politics of wartime intelligence. In particular, it contests some of the claims made by R. V. Jones in his memoir, Most Secret War (1978), about the role of photographic interpretation in the Crossbow investigation. It also demonstrates the wider importance of photographic intelligence in the British military history of the war and offers some explanation as to why this has become a ‘missing dimension’ of wartime intelligence studies.

Spies deep behind enemy lines; double agents; a Chinese American James Bond; black propaganda radio broadcasters; guerrilla fighters; pirates; smugglers; prostitutes and dancers as spies; and Asian Americans collaborating with Axis Powers.

All these colorful individuals form the story of Asian Americans in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of today's CIA. Brian Masaru Hayashi brings to light for the first time the role played by Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Americans in America's first centralized intelligence agency in its fight against the Imperial Japanese forces in east Asia during World War II. They served deep behind enemy lines gathering intelligence for American and Chinese troops locked in a desperate struggle against Imperial Japanese forces on the Asian continent. Other Asian Americans produced and disseminated statements by bogus peace groups inside the Japanese empire to weaken the fighting resolve of the Japanese. Still others served with guerrilla forces attacking enemy supply and communication lines behind enemy lines. Engaged in this deadly conflict, these Asian Americans agents encountered pirates, smugglers, prostitutes, and dancers serving as the enemy's spies, all the while being subverted from within the OSS by a double agent and without by co-ethnic collaborators in wartime Shanghai.

Drawing on recently declassified documents, Asian American Spies challenges the romanticized and stereotyped image of these Chinese, Japanese, and Korean American agents—the Model Minority-while offering a fresh perspective on the Allied victory in the Pacific Theater of World War II.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/JXKHIUAG,2021-10-14,Brian Masaru Hayashi,Oxford University Press,,2022-12-20T09:28:21Z,"['ZMVDB8A2', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

During those years, the Hamas practice was to apply different degrees of detention and torture of those suspected of collaborating. However, in some cases, Hamas chose a different tactic of exploiting collaborators to transform a threat into an opportunity. Hamas turned some collaborators into double agents, using them to advance its objectives. This article examines some of the doubling operations carried out by Hamas on Israeli collaborators over the last three decades. Examining these cases reveal how Hamas’s doubling methods developed over time, concurrently with the movement’s evolution. Thus, the doubling operations became more organized and sophisticated, being used for propaganda and deterrence purposes as well as other goals. The article explores an interesting aspect of Hamas’s counterintelligence activity in its struggle against the state of Israel. In addition, it sheds light on how a nonstate organization can use doubling of sources as part of its asymmetric war against a state.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ELS98FQ8,2023-01-02,Netanel Flamer,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2022-12-09T18:02:08Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'RHJFPRAI', 'TLFN4NAL', 'EJW4BLAR']"

As privatization and outsourcing function as primary techniques of ‘good governance’ in many western nations, security studies has offered numerous analyses of this phenomenon, particularly with the privatisation of military force in light of the GWOT. By putting contributions in security studies in dialogue with le Carré’s post-Cold War novels, I argue that le Carré’s post-Cold War novels explore how outsourcing war strategies during the Cold War become essential components of statecraft and security during the neoliberal moment when economic national security dominates in the face of the loss of clear sovereign enemies and state actors. Specifically, le Carré’s post-Cold War novels dramatise critically how market-driven security works between national or international legal orders, particularly in colonial and neocolonial contexts. I conclude that le Carré’s novels reveal an important ethical function for literature in modelling speculative scenarios for reflection on intelligence, security, and transformations in sovereignty while this paradoxical reality unfolds",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/2R99X2GW,2022-12-09,J.

The chapter then looks at what roles organisational structure, intelligence gaps and failures, and the politicisation of intelligence play in the greater national security context.

The bombings in Madrid in March 2004 have demonstrated how terrorists and criminals can continue to exploit the limits of hesitant or partial exchange to dangerous effect. Intelligence and security cooperation remain problematic because of the fundamental tension between an increasingly networked world, which is ideal terrain for the new religious terrorism, and highly compartmentalized national intelligence gathering. If cooperation is to improve, we require a better mutual understanding about the relationship between privacy and security to help us decide what sort of intelligence should be shared. This is a higher priority than building elaborate new structures.

Enemy moles in intelligence organizations are dangerous in more than one way.

2960,"World war I and the invention of American intelligence, 1878-1918",Thesis,https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/21126/,"Intelligence changes as the nature of war changes. From the late 1870s, the United States military, as part of a broader reform process, began learning about intelligence in part from experience but more importantly by observing the practices of the great powers of Europe. The period of American involvement in World War I saw a rapid acceleration of this dev.elopment, with the United States continuing to 
learn from the United Kingdom and France. The war also saw intelligence spreading into fields that it had seldom if ever entered in the American experience. During the 
nineteen months of American belligerency American Intelligence agencies, notably the War Department's Military Intelligence Division and the Navy Department's Office of Naval Intelligence expanded greatly. In addition, the services started to adopt high technology tools such as aerial photography and signals intelligence. 
These new tools required the admission into the military departments and services of esoteric specialists who did not fit previous military stereotypes. The war also 
occasioned a vast expansion of domestic surveillance and intelligence, a result of the idea that the World War was a struggle not only of militaries but of entire societies.

It is known that the assessments produced throughout 1906 were pessimistic. What is missing from the current historiography is the intelligence dimension. This paper fills this gap by arguing that the assessments were pessimistic because military and political assessors knew that the Dardanelles defences were strong. They knew this fact because British intelligence departments had compiled detailed and accurate information demonstrating that the Dardanelles defence system had been modernised and strengthened by the Ottomans over the preceding three decades.,https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZWRFYLAW,2022-11-10,Yusuf Ali Ozkan,,Intelligence and National Security,2022-11-23T08:12:05Z,"['9DTPTK46', '4BH8AYZE', '8F9EJ6CT']"

A distinguished aviator, he was suspected of disclosing classified information to the Japanese over the years 1923 to 1925 and 1939 to 1941. MI5’s investigation was inconclusive. But with the progressive release of agency materials from the late 1990s, Sempill attracted high-profile interest from historians and media alike. In 2012, he was labeled “the traitor of Pearl Harbor,” a canard with implications for the integrity of the early Atlantic alliance. This fresh study of a major early-modern counterespionage case reassesses Sempill in relation to his professional and political milieu and explores his Japanese connections as Tokyo moved from guarded friendship to challenge and aggression in the climacteric year 1941. Notwithstanding his admission of a technical breach of the Official Secrets Act in 1925, the evidence overall does not support the prevailing view of Sempill as a spy who betrayed British and American interests.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/JQS7S6BL,2022-07-25,Alex Hardie,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2022-07-28T22:18:06Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'ZMVDB8A2', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

In the 1960s, KGB counterintelligence officers were urged to implement active measures, instead of passive surveillance, by cultivating and recruiting foreign visitors and Soviet citizens with the aim of using them to penetrate Western institutions and collect sensitive intelligence. The counterintelligence directorate occasionally supervised foreign operations to implement offensive tactics. Given the parallels between the Soviet and Russian intelligence services, the expansion of the counterintelligence agency (the Federal Security Service) in post-Soviet Russia can be interpreted as its increased interest in and capabilities for active measures abroad.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/DJMMJ9X8,2022-07-03,Sanshiro Hosaka,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2022-11-06T23:28:19Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE', 'RHJFPRAI', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

The recruitment and handling of spies is essential if the US and its allies are to cool relations carefully, enact sound policy and curb the relentless intelligence operations of their adversaries. However, despite the superficially more open borders of China and Russia, technological advances have made the threat of street surveillance to the recruitment and handling of agents today as acute as it was in Cold War “denied area” states. This paper assesses the degree of street surveillance in contemporary Russia and China – including the impact of biometrics and online data history on the defensibility of cover and the severity of advanced CCTV networks – and the solutions intelligence agencies might adopt to address these problems. Despite the possibilities cyberspace offers espionage – for instance, by reducing the need for face to face meetings between intelligence officers and agents – the paper establishes the limitations of technological answers and argues that Western intelligence officers are entering a new era of Moscow and Beijing Rules in which they are more essential than ever and yet need to operate with absolute caution.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3YY9ILDB,2021-11-10,Kyle S.

Kim was released after the end of WWII and reinvented himself as a writer of spy fiction, arguing that the Soviet Union must score victories against the West on the literary front.

Germany replaced Russia and the Comintern as the primary target. The arm of German military power which commanded the most attention was the Luftwaffe, Germany's new air force. The bomber was the only weapon with which Germany could directly threaten Britain; by which London and the industrial Midlands could be made vulnerable; which could strike at the civilian population. Out of this nexus of strategic anxieties, the air staff created their ‘worst-case’ assumption. The worst case, as the air ministry consistently saw it during the 1930s, was a massive German air attack launched against Great Britain with the object of forcing a quick surrender, primarily through the collapse of civilian morale. Group Captain J. C. Slessor, director of plans in the air ministry (and a future chief of the air staff), admitted in his memoirs that,’ in those years immediately before the war the possibility of what was referred to as the knock-out blow bore very heavily on the minds of the Air Staff’.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/N3P39VG4,1982/09,Wesley K.

Intelligence cooperation via outer space, described as the ‘strategic essence’ of this relationship, is poised for transformation. New technologies are being developed for satellite communication, with laser systems capable of bypassing ground control stations outside US territory. As a result, the one indispensable role for Australia in US national security—hosting infrastructure to relay intelligence about nuclear and missile activity—could become irrelevant in the years ahead. With questions raised about the Trump administration’s commitment to security partners and the risk of US disengagement from Asia, these findings have implications for Australian alliance diplomacy. If intelligence ties bind these countries together at present, Canberra can expect some risk of loosening in the future and will need to think carefully about the development of national intelligence resources over the long term.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZQ3UIEAW,"July 4, 2018",David Schaefer,,Australian Journal of International Affairs,2022-03-07T16:02:09Z,"['PBHFUE8W', 'T92JK7A5']"

Both non-spies and former intel officers have crafted spy thrillers that have won critical and popular praise. What are the differences between writing spy novels with or without previous intelligence experience? What are the challenges of writing realistic spy fiction? How much creative license is needed to make it exciting? How much realism is sacrificed in the process? How do real life spies react to spy fiction? How different is their response to that of the broader public?

Join the Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security as senior fellow David Priess talked with critically acclaimed authors Alma Katsu, Karen Cleveland, and Brad Thor about spy writing in the real world and about their exciting new novels.

Award-winning author Alma Katsu  a former CIA and NSA analyst, has written five novels prior to RED WIDOW, her first spy novel, which was named in March a NY Times Editor's Choice and is in development for a TV series with FOX.

Karen Cleveland is a former CIA analyst and the New York Times bestselling author of NEED TO KNOW and KEEP YOU CLOSE. Her third novel, YOU CAN RUN, will be published in August.

Brad Thor is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of 21 thrillers. His newest, BLACK ICE, continues the adventures of Scot Harvath, America’s top spy, will be published June 22nd.

The Hayden Center is located at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government in Arlington, VA. General Michael V. Hayden, our founder and former director of CIA and NSA, has been a distinguished visiting professor at Schar School for 11 years.

How will it approach non-traditional challenges like climate change? What technology will the IC use? How might America’s adversaries take advantage of these developments?

It argues that a more fitting epitaph for the literature from intelligence history's earliest days is better designated as the ‘Muckraker Era’, rather than the ‘airport bookstall’. My argument proceeds on three fronts. First, these writers from the latter half of the twentieth century – rather than being cast out as pariahs – should be thought of as trailblazers, as many of the techniques they pioneered have formed the methodological backbone of historical research into intelligence. Second, the literature from this period, triangulated with recent scholarship, should be re-examined, as precious practical contributions can be identified. Lastly, throughout the article I will attempt to recast the literature from this period, offering a new more constructive perspective that is in keeping with the ethos of today's professional historian. My argument focuses on the works of three authors – Rebecca West, Gordon Brook-Shepherd and John Bulloch – as emblematic authors of the Muckraker Era, in methods, contribution and the indifference of subsequent intelligence scholars to their work.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/E77TAFFR,2017,Jules Gaspard,,History,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,"['4BH8AYZE', '8F9EJ6CT']"

France had played a pivotal role in early peacetime Sigint cooperation, the breaking the Enigma and collaboration with Great Britain continued even after the fall of France in 1940.

The recent digitalisation of secret records of conversations between German prisoners of war, made by British intelligence, enables computer-based research on that topic. This article will analyse various statements from around 400 German soldiers concerning their intelligence system, its organisation and usefulness. They each perceived the organisation and personnel of the German system in different ways depending on personal experience. Collection methods were widely discussed and in the case of the use of force during interrogation situations criticised. The analysis of raw material and the link between intelligence and its use in battle can be found to a lesser extent. Although German prisoners mentioned successful applications of intelligence within combat situations enthusiastic comments increasingly diminished during the course of the war. In addition, a growing awareness of a functioning British intelligence system can be detected. The appreciation of the significance of intelligence and its use in combat remained very limited. Summing up, the secret protocols offer a unique access to contemporary views on intelligence and to a German perception in particular.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/RLLTA8C7,"January 1, 2013",Falko Bell,,Journal of Intelligence History,2022-03-04T22:24:12Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

German agents were active both to gather information on the Entente and to know more about the Dutch defence and the Dutch political and military intentions.

Yet, despite its successful work and the realisation throughout Whitehall that economic intelligence would be needed after the war, Enemy Branch was wound down even before the conflict was over. This article seeks to answer the puzzling question of Enemy Branch's demise while the rest of the intelligence community continued to prosper. It puts the demise of Enemy Branch into the context of the ‘Cold War in Whitehall’, the quarrel between the Foreign Office and the Chiefs of Staff over British post-war policies towards the Soviet Union. The Foreign Office briefly took over Enemy Branch in the last year of the war to use its expertise in order to run the Economic and Industrial Planning Staff, but it had no long-term interest in this economic intelligence organisation. The military, on the other hand, had long-term needs for economic intelligence, but was loath to partake in an inter-departmental economic intelligence organisation, particularly when it was controlled by the Foreign Office. In the end, despite its good track record, Enemy Branch succumbed to bureaucratic infighting and the lack of a natural ally to shelter it.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/NNLNH6WS,"June 1, 2013",Michael Seibold,,Journal of Intelligence History,2022-03-04T21:43:09Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

Opponents multiplied in the complex and ruthless world of espionage, and honest allies were hard to find. The descendant of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the Strategic Services Unit (SSU), the X-2 Branch (the surviving counter-intelligence branch of the OSS), Army and Naval Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Group (CIG) and ultimately, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were the key agencies handling secret human sources, witnessing the rapid decay of the KMT regime, the performance of its security apparatus, and the PLA’s secret activities among the urban population. US intelligence also noted the extensive recruitment of Japanese intelligence networks and operators to serve the Soviets, the KMT regime and the Communist Party of China (CPC); only a couple of years earlier Japanese spies were the enemy, and now they were deemed expert intelligence assets, to be employed without hesitation.

Seth, as Agent Blunderhead, was parachuted into German-occupied Estonia late in 1942 to destroy the country’s vital shale oil plants. Upon landing, Seth was swiftly captured and offered to work for the Germans as a double agent. In April 1945, Seth was sent over the German border into Switzerland as SD Agent 22D, where he promptly presented the British with sensational peace terms from Himmler. This article presents the British security services’ remarkable conclusions and indicates that, in their opinion, Seth was ‘spiritually so much under German domination that he intends to work for an Anglo-German understanding and an anti-Russian policy after the war’, had ‘not told us all about the services he rendered to the Germans’, was of ‘unbalanced character and rabidly anti-Soviet’, ‘extremely untruthful’, prone to ‘megalomania’ and that ‘neither his loyalty to this country nor his discretion were all that could be desired’. Seth was also considered to be a post-war security threat whose job opportunities should be restricted. Despite these revelations, Seth was never prosecuted and was able to become a successful post-war espionage author.

These secret dossiers not only reveal how closely the army’s newly formed Bureau of Military Intelligence worked with Bismarck and his diplomats in the first decade of the Empire’s existence. They also offer new insights into the operations and achievements of the Germany army’s early espionage activities. Up until now, little has been known about these years since all of the relevant archival material was thought to have been destroyed in April 1945. So for the first time, this study is able to tell the closely linked tales of these early German intelligence operations and how they were monitored and used by the diplomats in Berlin.

Born from revolutionary crisis in the late 1920s, the Red Army’s SIGINT service was founded in 1931, an offshoot of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s development of wireless communications. Though the USSR provided some training assistance, the formative early development of the service relied more on indigenous resources: the training of teenage novices in underground facilities in Shanghai and the Central Soviet and the use of equipment that was self-made, illicitly procured or seized on the battlefield. In the years that followed, Red Army SIGINT – much respected by CCP/Red Army leaders – survived defections and cryptographic obstacles to play a major role in the defence of the Central Soviet against Guomindang encirclement. As military defeat became inevitable, SIGINT also helped to facilitate the successful Red Army retreat that became the historic Long March.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/RRYN8KXW,"July 3, 2014",David Ian Chambers,,Journal of Intelligence History,2022-03-03T17:06:32Z,"['T92JK7A5', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

The intelligence function of the IOTF was to undertake measures of effects of the propaganda efforts which also entailed psychological operations or PSYOP. The measures of effect entailed data gathering by polling and surveying the 30 million recipients of the propaganda effort through television commercials, radio broadcasts, newspaper editorials and street billboards. The data gathering and subsequent analysis were significant in the planning and implementation of the Baghdad Security Pact and the Petraeus Surge of coalition forces commencing April 2007 as a prelude to the withdrawal of coalition forces from Iraq in 2010.

This article examines the underexplored role of Allied signals intelligence in the Mediterranean theater with reference to original decrypts of German communications between 1942 and 1943. The Mediterranean Sea was of key strategic significance for Allied and Axis supply lines; Ultra played a significant role in sustaining Allied shipping and impeding the transportation of Axis supplies across the Mediterranean. After an in-depth examination of communications the British were intercepting in the Mediterranean, this article presents three factors necessary for effective use of Ultra, which coalesced in 1942 to allow Ultra to play a significant role in the outcome of the battle over supply lines in the Mediterranean theater.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5FICYWJH,"July 3, 2014",Maria Robson,,Journal of Intelligence History,2022-03-03T17:05:58Z,"['T92JK7A5', '4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

Parts of these operations concentrated on the antifascist German refugee community, although neither the communists nor the pacifists among them constituted a threat to national security, but rather supported Great Britain’s war effort. This article explores the observation of friendly aliens, which was driven by a fear of communists among British officials and the refugees themselves who willingly delivered information about their fellow immigrants. Using informants’ reports and the correspondence between one of the key informants and his MI5 handler it describes the measures that ranged from surveillance to torture.

Shortly after his arrival in Sweden in June 1944, however, Blankenfelds got in touch with the British diplomatic mission in Stockholm, told them of his assignment and became a double agent, maintaining contacts with the Germans while continually providing information to the British, who in turn kept the Swedish police informed. Blankenfelds was later arrested and interrogated by the Swedes and, when released, agreed to provide them with information as well. He thereby significantly contributed to the arrest and extradition of a German agent in Sweden – the Head of the German tourist agency in Sweden, Baron Bernd von Gossler. Blankenfelds’ assignment to America was repeatedly delayed throughout the autumn of 1944 and by late October, Berlin ordered the mission to be called off altogether. In the meantime, the Germans had tried to have Blankenfelds engage in intelligence activities in Sweden aimed at the Baltic refugee community. Blankenfelds refused however to cooperate.

In the following two years he maintained contacts with no less than five diplomatic missions in Sweden – Britain, Germany, Japan, Spain and the United States – and provided them with false intelligence in return for money. In May 1945, after having tried to trick the Japanese mission in Stockholm to believe that he was a defected Soviet agent operating in Sweden under the false cover of a US citizen, Henri Brunsso Donoa, while simultaneously trying to have the Americans and British to believe that he had been assigned by the Japanese for an intelligence mission in the US, he was arrested by the Swedish police on charges of illegal intelligence activities and was deported later. After two years – in October 1947 – he turned up at the Swedish diplomatic mission in Warsaw claiming that the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who had been arrested by the Soviets in January 1945 in Budapest, had managed to escape his Soviet guards and was staying with Polish partisans in southeast Poland.

Throughout the war, the government of William Morris Hughes had been engaged in a bitter conflict with radicals, trade unions, Irish nationalists, and members of the Labor Party over implementing the policy of military conscription. Twice the issue was put to the Australian people in a referendum, and twice it was defeated. The Hughes government saw this defeat partly as the result of the anti-conscription movement. Consequently, it had no scruples in using the intelligence services to suppress its political enemies. Within this context, this paper looks at how intelligence, throughout the conscription campaigns, became a means of suppressing political opposition and dissent. It discusses the government’s rationale for such behaviour and offers an assessment of the circumambient conditions that enabled intelligence to be used for political gain.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/N4BUK5B9,"January 2, 2017",Justin T.

After a brief discussion of the state of intelligence and security studies in Austria, the authors provide a comparison to Singapore, a nation with similar geopolitical issues as well as a different and, arguably, more developed and comprehensive academic program to confront and deal effectively with security challenges. The article concludes with four critical suggestions for the establishment of a ‘Central European’ Intelligence and Security Studies program in Austria. The authors recommend combining academics and practitioners on program faculties, emphases on domestic, regional and extra-regional factors in both program contents and the composition of student bodies, an interdisciplinary approach to the critical role of ideologies, and the development of specific expertise in order to understand and confront regional threats.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/32XCT8F4,"January 2, 2020","Andreas Wimmer, Duncan Bare, William B.

The paper deconstructs the various elements of the American failure and explores the reasons that led to it. The paper shows that at the heart of the flawed American assessment was a paradigm formulated by U.S. intelligence analysts, one that was influenced by Israeli intelligence analysts.

It argues that for women, the intelligence service sector is just like any other paid employment: with time, women were gradually integrated in it; and the level of their involvement reflected the level of women's emancipation in the given society. Women working for the intelligence services had to counter workplace discrimination just like any other female employee in more ordinary jobs. However, intelligence work has an additional special feature: sexism and gender-based discrimination are intrinsic parts of it, because the deployment of femininity as “Otherness” is part and parcel of the trade and the result of deliberate methodological decisions.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/CPBN744I,"July 2, 2020",Andrea Pető,,Journal of Intelligence History,2022-03-03T15:41:57Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

The formation of the CIA capped two years of change in the existing intelligence agencies. The Office of Strategic Studies (OSS) closed shop after the war, and the Central Intelligence Group (CIG) was destined to fail even from the time of its creation in January 1946. Although President Harry S Truman may have had some interest in the formation of the CIA, there were other factors here. The fact that his administration established the most prominent intelligence agency in U.S. history does not necessarily mean that he was a keen authority on foreign intelligence. Truman had only a marginal role in the formation of the government’s foreign intelligence apparatus and showed only a limited understanding of the gathering and use of foreign intelligence during the first two years of his presidency.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/QEU4T9QS,"July 2, 2020",Scott A.

In support of quality assurance and decision making,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/16161262.2020.1864863,"This paper addresses urgent information needs in today’s unsettled cyber domain. Dealing with complex cyber questions decision-makers will arguably benefit from an alternative analytical point of view. Academic research has shown that decisions benefit from assessments and advice based upon differing points of view. Devil’s advocacy, which criticizes established positions, and offers alternative perspectives to any given argument based upon the same inputs, is one established instrument to try to achieve this. The paper explores analytical lessons learned within the Israeli military system as a result of the Yom Kippur war of 1973. The unexpected outbreak of war showed the urgent need for improvements in assessment and decision-making processes. A ‘devil’s advocate shop’ was subsequently set up within Israeli military intelligence. The prolonged Israeli experience with devil’s advocacy might serve its purpose in the virtual world. This requires re-transformation of the Devil’s Advocacy concept into a Cyber tool in order to protect decision-makers from cognitive pitfalls and offering them a better perspective of complex cyber issues at stake.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/T5872RXE,"January 2, 2021",A.

First, the nature of historic accelerated weapon programs is studied, so that common elements and indicators can be developed. An analytical framework based upon the generalized way in which all ‘crash’ programs are run is then constructed. With this analytical framework, when some aspect of a program are uncovered, inferences to aspects which have not yet been observed can be drawn. Using this approach for uncovering ‘crash’ programs implies however a new partnership between collectors and analysts. A strategy to search for ‘crash’ programs is constructed in order to focus the collection and analytical energy on the problem of looking for such a program. This approach is three-stepped. The strategy uses an initial step of understanding the adversary’s perceptions to guide the search to the industrial sectors most likely to harbor such a program. A second step uses a search of that industrial sector for change which would point to specific activities and locations. And finally, detailed analysis and collection focused against the specific facilities uncover details that lead to the truth.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/T38GE676,"January 2, 2021",Danny Pronk,,Journal of Intelligence History,2022-03-03T15:39:49Z,['CZJ36V8L']

This can result in politicization, which ultimately might result in intelligence being blamed for policy failures. This has a negative impact on intelligence analysis, transforming it in an ever more cautious direction which negates its utility in the policy process. Swedish intelligence learnt that for truly important intelligence reporting, in particular that which signified paradigm shifts, the conclusions had to be presented in a manner that had an impact, in an oral briefing. Moreover, the briefer must be prepared to defend the service’s conclusions. Hence, a keyword in the analyst-policy maker relationship was trust. The relationship had to develop into a partnership, in which the policy maker had the final word but the intelligence analyst did not shrink from presenting the service’s argument.

This change focused on the relationship between intelligence and Downing Street. Previous premiers were uninterested, naïve and inexperienced in their approach. When Churchill took office all this changed since he not only harnessed the power of intelligence but also oversaw the development of a central brain in the form of the joint assessment machinery. Yet it required Clement Attlee, with a rather different personality from Churchill, to complete the revolution. Together they not only developed the machinery used by successive prime ministers, they also trained Eden, Macmillan, and Douglas-Home in the transformative power of intelligence – changing the nature of the core executive in the process.

They concluded that an invasion by regular Arab armies in response to a declaration of a Jewish state would be a ‘low probability’ and that Arab propaganda calling for the destruction of Israel only amounted to a war of nerves. Today it is abundantly clear that the intelligence agencies failed to weigh these factors correctly. In fact, what primarily motivated the Arab regimes to launch an all-out war was indeed their internal and external situation, since by so doing they could divert public attention away from their internal problems and ameliorate their external status.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/X5KFWTMM,"July 3, 2021",Yoram Fried,,Journal of Intelligence History,2022-03-03T15:36:36Z,"['DHLN8GE4', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

By reconstructing a multidimensional story that focuses on both the impact of the Soviet Union on the end of the Portuguese Empire in Africa and the effect of the anticolonial struggles on the Soviet Union, Natalia Telepneva bridges the gap between the narratives of individual anticolonial movements and those of superpower rivalry in sub-Saharan Africa during the Cold War.  
 
Drawing on newly available archival sources from Russia and Eastern Europe and interviews with key participants, Telepneva emphasizes the agency of African liberation leaders who enlisted the superpower into their movements via their relationships with middle-ranking members of the Soviet bureaucracy. These administrators had considerable scope to shape policies in the Portuguese colonies which in turn increased the Soviet commitment to decolonization in the wider region. An innovative reinterpretation of the relationships forged between African revolutionaries and the countries of the Warsaw Pact, Cold War Liberation is a bold addition to debates about policy-making in the Global South during the Cold War.

3178,Counterintelligence Vetting Techniques Compared across Multiple Domains,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/08850607.2020.1836603,"This discussion examines how security and counterintelligence vetting practices vary across domains and how this informs our understanding of counterintelligence disciplines. Organizations in each domain must ensure that persons admitted as insiders can be trusted with sensitive information and the organization’s security. We look at some examples of counterintelligence vetting, seeking commonalities in vetting needs and practices between armed groups, corporations, and states. We compare, in depth, the vetting practices of Lebanese Hezbollah, the reconstituted Syrian intelligence services, the drug-trafficking group known as Los Zetas, and High-Value Technology Companies (HVTCs). The evident regularities and commonalities in counterintelligence vetting suggest cross-domain and cross-cultural targets for exploitation.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/LJ83JPBR,"October 2, 2021","Blake W.

TASS is Authorized to Announce … (1979) is a fictional version of a CIA operation involving Soviet diplomat Aleksandr Ogorodnik (a.k.a. TRIGON). The novel confirms Director of Central Intelligence Stansfield Turner’s suspicion that Ogorodnik was a KGB dangle whose rumored suicide was false. It also foreshadowed the KGB’s bogus claim that the CIA was an accessory to Ogorodnik’s murder of his mistress.

For example, how did the scientific, intelligence, and strategic studies communities issue accurate diffuse warnings of the growing risk of a global pandemic? This raises the possibility that the warnings issued might have been misleading because they focus on the disease’s details and not on the second- and third-order effects that would significantly impede national and global responses to coronavirus. The pandemic outbreak also led to the acceleration of ongoing work in the pharmaceutical industry, producing “game-changing” medical advances that might soon be replicated in other fields.

Schelling salience refers to how certain aspects can spontaneously and tacitly become collectively cognitively prominent, and thus, coordinate behavior. Short-term benefits of a predominant mindset may generate long-term biases in analysis, collection, and decisionmakers’ responsiveness. Strong mindsets do not inevitably generate intelligence failures. However, a particular organizational state, referred to as a “pleasant attractor,” where sustained strategies produce satisficing outcomes and alternative strategies are more uncertain and/or costly, is conducive to biased mindsets causing intelligence failures. Findings from an examination of nineteen historical cases of intelligence failures and successes, with an emphasis on four sequences of cases with an initial intelligence failure, supported the model.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/PZ3DHK58,"January 2, 2022",Ralf Lillbacka,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2022-03-03T14:24:01Z,['D7XFV7JL']

These, in turn, reflected a more fundamental and ongoing transformation in that relationship arising from “revolution in military affairs” during the 1990s. The article traces the debate up to its premature termination by fiat in 2011 and concludes that these issues remain to be properly addressed in UK and allied intelligence doctrine.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/TEHF3ZNT,"January 2, 2022",Philip H.

Specifically, the analyst needs to evaluate the robustness of a policy to the uncertainty of an assessment. The analyst must have both topical expertise in the disciplines underlying the analysis, as well as decision-theoretic expertise in managing uncertainty. This is demonstrated by applying info-gap decision theory and the concept of robust-satisficing to the analysis of policy in response to al-Qaeda prior to 11 September 2001, which illustrates the combination of topical and decision-theoretic expertise.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YPAVJ9IR,"January 2, 2022",Yakov Ben-Haim,,Intl Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence,2022-03-03T14:22:29Z,['CZJ36V8L']

Interpretations range from the assertion of his biographer that he did essentially nothing illegal to the more recent claim that the technical information he provided to the Imperial Navy helped make the Pearl Harbor attack possible. This article uses recently declassified American documents and Japanese sources to shed new light on Rutland’s activities, his role in the wider Japanese intelligence apparatus, and the nature of his mission. Contra most previous analyses, these suggest that the Japanese Navy viewed Rutland as an agent with future potential for wartime rather than one who had already provided valuable services. Those included creating close relationships with high-profile Americans to get strategic information rather than technical intelligence. They also suggest that the Japanese Navy’s skewed view of Rutland prevented it from developing a more effective prewar intelligence network, with dire consequences.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/7EC3U5Q6,"January 2, 2022","Ron Drabkin, Bradley W.

Under cover of diplomatic recognition, trade agreements, and local communist parties, Soviets sent numerous clandestine agents abroad to pursue national security objectives, including theft of military and industrial secrets on a large scale. France, Britain, and the United States were the main targets in which, organizationally, Soviet intelligence used a consistent pattern. As an existential threat, France was the first priority until displaced by the fear of German rearmament. France represented a rich resource for advanced military and industrial technology that the Soviets needed to transform Russia’s infrastructure.

In multilateral discussions about norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, digital political espionage is the elephant in the room. Like other aspects of inter-state intelligence competition, digital espionage is ‘business as usual’ but can also lead to tensions, particularly when operations become public. The strategic consequences of digital espionage appear significant, as asymmetries of state power and poor understanding of technical aspects of cyber operations lead to uncertainty about appropriate responses to ‘cyber victimhood’. We offer multiple propositions to frame state responses to digital espionage, focusing on the relational power of the victim and spying states and their bilateral relationships. States will generally respond proportionately to state-on-state digital espionage, whilst domestic-political factors pressure them to adopt more robust, cost-imposing measures that may exacerbate the strategic consequences of digital espionage. We illustrate these propositions with three recent cases – the Snowden revelations (2013); the Office of Personnel Management breach (2014); and the SolarWinds breach (2020) – and explore the importance of calibrated responses to digital political espionage for strategic stability and state behavioural norms in cyberspace.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BRIL5EXJ,"September 2, 2021","Joe Devanny, Ciaran Martin, Tim Stevens",,Journal of Cyber Policy,2022-02-16T08:42:25Z,"['8XXD789V', '8F9EJ6CT']"

We explore why and how Putin opted to strike at the moment he did to seek vengeance against Skripal, concluding that a confluence of structural and human factors at the intersection of British government policies with Russian domestic politics led Putin to his decision.

Long before the inception of SIS and the CIA, in the period of the Renaissance, the Republic of Venice had masterminded a remarkable centrally-organised state intelligence organisation that played a pivotal role in the defence of the Venetian empire. Housed in the imposing Doge's Palace and under the direction of the Council of Ten, the notorious governmental committee that acted as Venice's spy chiefs, this 'proto-modern' organisation served prominent intelligence functions including operations (intelligence and covert action), analysis, cryptography and steganography, cryptanalysis, and even the development of lethal substances. Official informants and amateur spies were shipped across Europe, Anatolia, and Northern Africa, conducting Venice's stealthy intelligence operations. Revealing a plethora of secrets, their keepers, and their seekers, Venice's Secret Service explores the social and managerial processes that enabled their existence and that furnished the foundation for an extraordinary intelligence organisation created by one of the early modern world's most cosmopolitan states.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Z4QXCL45,2019,Ioanna Iordanou,Oxford University Press,,2021-11-22T20:49:04Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

3250,"Espionage in the 16th century Mediterranean: secret diplomacy, Mediterranean go-betweens and the Ottoman-Habsburg rivalry",Thesis,https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/557617,"Spies played a crucial role in early modern imperial rivalries. While past scholars have emphasized the Islam/Christendom divide in the Mediterranean, these go-betweens, who mastered the codes of both cultures, easily crossed invisible boundaries between civilizations and connected the Ottomans and the Habsburgs, two imperial powers at each other's throat. Apart from providing both empires with regular information on political and military developments, these entrepreneur information brokers played an active diplomatic role between two capitals and even participated in Ottoman factional politics.
 
This dissertation compares both empires' secret services and explains the differences between the two systems of information gathering based on these empires' differing organizational structures. It argues that the Habsburgs tried to institutionalize and standardize their secret services in accordance with their general efforts of bureaucratization and centralization, even though the effect of such efforts remained rather limited in the Levant. The Ottomans, on the other hand, maintained their longstanding decentralized approach and delegated the responsibility of gathering information to pashas and court favourites who established their own intelligence networks. This created a rather different situation whereby these networks served their masters's interests rather than that of the state, thus giving the historian ample information on Ottoman factional politics. In relying on oral communication and not following the recent developments in steganography and cryptography, the Ottoman secret service was more personal than institutional.
 
Still, the Ottoman secret service produced good results. In spite of these differences that could have been otherwise considered shortcomings and contrary to the unwarranted assumptions that prevailed in Western historiography, the Ottomans successfully developed a functional information gathering mechanism which in itself was coherent. The real factor that negatively affected the efficiency of both empires was the lack of direct diplomacy between two capitals. While both empires kept themselves informed of political developments and military preparations, they failed to develop an awareness of each other's legal, political and economic systems as well as cultural, linguistic and religious particularities.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/MHW8I5BK,2012,Emrah Safa Gurkan,,,2022-01-10T11:38:54Z,"['DS3WDJUS', '4BH8AYZE', 'AZ3BZ9BR']"

Given the global prevalence of English, the countries comprising the Five Eyes intelligence alliance should build upon existing proven frameworks to cooperate to secure their shared information environment. Working in real-time across these states to create a common picture of the threat environment and harmonized security and regulatory approaches would benefit defensive information space security efforts, as well as make the private sector a more effective and accountable security partner in the information space. Echoing the impassioned foresight of Winston Churchill, whose invocation to common cause shaped a political balance of power for three generations, this paper argues that the contemporary Five Eyes community would see fundamental benefits in uniting against a modern scourge of disinformation along the lines of classified information exchange models dating back nearly a century. This issue brief recommends steps toward a common regulatory environment for information platforms, greater civic defense, individual education, rapid liaison information exchange, adoption of existing best practices, and greater resources toward international research to support and refine electoral laws against evolving threats.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BEKYHLCR,2021-05-10T14:30:00+00:00,"Daniel Dobrowolski, David Gioe, Trey Herr",,,2021-12-11T23:42:55Z,"['T92JK7A5', '8XXD789V', '8F9EJ6CT']"

The combination of unequal socioeconomic structures, an authoritarian political culture, and uncooperative political dynamics explain such imbalances. During the Military Dictatorship (1964–1985), the National Information Service (SNI) was effective against those opposing the regime. The New Republic (1985–2014) tried to overcome its legacy. In 1990, the SNI was closed down. In the first decade after the Cold War, security reforms lingered. The National Congress established the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN) in 1999. Over two decades, the Brazilian Intelligence System (SISBIN) expanded to 42 leading agencies. Legislative oversight developed slowly and narrowly focused on ABIN. Although prone to various crises, Brazil was able to keep the trilemma democracy, security, and development in precarious equilibrium. Tight reelection for Dilma Rousseff (PT) in 2014 marked a new prolonged economic crisis and bitterly polarized politics in Brazil. Under Bolsonaro, there is concern about the military tutelage, undue politicization of law enforcement and security, and insufficient legislative oversight.

The Danubian theatre, one of the crucial scenes of the war, witnessed both belligerents trying to discover the other's activities and planned operations. As they were inhabited by cosmopolitan and heterogeneous populations, Dobruca (Dobruja) and Bessarabia were the most convenient places for both parties to gather military intelligence. The Ottomans acquired information via the Wallachians and the Cossacks, as well as by diplomatic missions and various merchants. The Ottoman Empire's Orthodox Christian subjects – the Bulgarians and Greeks – assisted Russia in gathering information from the right bank of the Danube. Some of these reports were unreliable, as were the spies themselves. The Russian and Ottoman archives have rich resources related to military intelligence, which is an understudied aspect of the Crimean War.

(http://www.bcmh.org.uk/event/call-for-papers-bcmh-new-researchers-conference-26-27-november-2021/) Abstract:The use of intelligence is always considered crucial during times of crisis and war. A small crisis in Taba (Egypt), suddenly erupted in early 1906 owing to a border dispute in the Sinai Peninsula, presents a good case where intelligence played an important role. During the crisis and its aftermath, the option of forcing the Dardanelles Straits to coerce the Ottomans was proposed and discussed in Whitehall. However, such a scheme was rejected by the Committee of Imperial Defence following a joint study by the intelligence and fighting departments. The main reason for the proposal being rejected is intelligence that had been collected since the Great Eastern Crisis of 1875-78. Recently established military and naval intelligence services had compiled information and produced regular reports that demonstrated how Turkish defences had been strengthened following the defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 and thus put forward the risks of forcing the Straits. Taba Crisis demonstrates how intelligence was successfully used in a crisis and impacted the government’s decision-making. The Crisis is also important as it led the way the last important assessment on the Dardanelles before the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915 being made. What makes it more significant is the fact that British military and political figures who would also be in similar positions in 1915 were involved in discussions in 1906-7. This case also supports the argument that British intelligence services were actually effective and produced regular intelligence reports before the foundation of Secret Service Bureau, the predecessor of MI6.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3U6J9CPE,2021/11/29,,,,2021-11-29T19:17:46Z,"['9DTPTK46', '4BH8AYZE']"

This partly reflects case-specific methodological challenges, tackled here through multiple overseas sources, but also the relative absence of research on intelligence and security communities in the Global South more generally. Approaching this lacunae head on, this article draws on security assistance literature related to ‘patron-client relations’ and ‘principal-agent’ theory to trace the nature and impact of limited British security assistance pre-independence, before demonstrating how and why significant change characterised Tanzania’s increasingly politicised and unstable security sector and its key international liaison partners post-independence. These changes would quickly end British hopes of integrating Tanzania into a ‘Commonwealth security culture’ of friendly post-colonial states, with Tanzania charting its own non-aligned path through a competition of Cold War patrons.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/L6G6GQN5,"January 2, 2021","Thomas J.

While the intelligence and security agencies are themselves exempt from the Act, releasing only such archival material into the public domain as they see fit, the article will argue that this does not mean that FOI cannot be used productively in this area. Rather, by adopting a wider definition of ‘intelligence’, as advocated by Wesley K. Wark in this journal in 1992, FOI can be used as part of a broader research strategy to secure the release of information that allows the archival study of intelligence to move beyond the material released by the agencies themselves. The article will illustrate this point by drawing on relevant examples of successful FOI requests, while also highlighting some of the related practical challenges and limitations that its use has revealed.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/RSXZGLFQ,2014/03,"Christopher J.

Once neglected in academia, the subject is now increasingly firmly established in British and American universities. Common interest in understanding the value as well as the limitations of intelligence nevertheless disguises differing epistemological foundations. Until the late 1980s official British attitudes to secrecy, including opposition to any form of public accountability, inhibited and distorted public understanding. The last two decades have seen changing attitudes to both archival disclosure and parliamentary accountability, though the significance of these is contested. This article outlines these changes as well as how various authors have used various sources to represent the secret world. Two specific areas are explored: covert action and the joint intelligence machinery. The former presents particularly interesting challenges to academic and public scrutiny (in some contrast to the United States) while the latter has received unprecedented illumination in the wake of the failure to discover weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

Deception in the cyber domain poses an immensely difficult challenge for states to differentiate between espionage activities in cyberspace and cyber attacks. The inability to distinguish between cyber activities places US cyber infrastructure in a perilous position and increases the possibility of a disproportionate or inadequate response to cyber incidents.

The fact that elected officials and senior officers fall victim to strategic surprise attacks launched by known adversaries is the problematique that animates the study of intelligence failure.

The utility of supply-side counts varies predictably based upon the underlying distribution of users. Yet, the likelihood of each distribution type varies inversely with its utility: uniform distributions are most useful for intelligence purposes but least likely and power law distributions are least useful but occur most commonly.

The global surveillance disclosures initiated by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have increased public and academic discussions about big data and national security. Yet, efforts to summarize and import insights from the vast and interdisciplinary literature on data analytics have remained rare in the field of security studies. To fill this gap, we explain the core characteristics of big data, provide an overview of the techniques and methods of data analytics, and explore how big data can support the core national security process of intelligence. Big data is not only defined by the volume of data but also by their velocity, variety and issues of veracity. Scientists have developed a number of techniques to extract information from big data and support national security practices. We find that data analytics tools contribute to and influence all the core intelligence functions in the contemporary US national security apparatus. However, these tools cannot replace the central role of humans and their ability to contextualize security threats.

The trend towards automation is both innovative and necessary. However, techno-centric efforts to replace human analysts with finely crafted algorithms across the board, from collection to synthesis and analysis of information, risk limiting the potential of OSINT rather than increasing its scope and impact.

On the one hand, it carried out covert intelligence operations in Irish territory, involving the Service intelligence branches, the Ministry of Information, and, most importantly, the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). On the other hand, unprecedented cooperation developed between military, police and intelligence agencies from Britain and Ireland, and in particular between MI5 and Irish military intelligence (G2). For most of the war British intelligence pursued this joint strategy of covert activity and official collaboration, and MI5 and SIS shared responsibility for Ireland. However, there was a gradual shift of emphasis towards cooperation and it was eventually concluded that the MI5-G2 link could serve all Britain's security needs.

3343,"Disrupt and Deny: Spies, Special Forces, and the Secret Pursuit of British Foreign Policy",Book,,"British leaders use spies and Special Forces to interfere in the affairs of others discreetly and deniably. Since 1945, MI6 has spread misinformation designed to divide and discredit targets from the Middle East to Eastern Europe and Northern Ireland. It has instigated whispering campaigns and planted false evidence on officials working behind the Iron Curtain, tried to foment revolution in Albania, blown up ships to prevent the passage of refugees to Israel, and secretly funnelled aid to insurgents in Afghanistan and dissidents in Poland. MI6 has launched cultural and economic warfare against Iceland and Czechoslovakia. It has tried to instigate coups in Congo, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and elsewhere. Through bribery and blackmail, Britain has rigged elections as colonies moved to independence. Britain has fought secret wars in Yemen, Indonesia, and Oman — and discreetly used Special Forces to eliminate enemies from colonial Malaya to Libya during the Arab Spring.   This is covert action: a vital, though controversial, tool of statecraft and perhaps the most sensitive of all government activity. If used wisely, it can play an important role in pursuing national interests in a dangerous world. If used poorly, it can cause political scandal — or worse.   In Disrupt and Deny, Rory Cormac tells the remarkable true story of Britain's secret scheming against its enemies, as well as its friends; of intrigue and manoeuvring within the darkest corridors of Whitehall, where officials fought to maintain control of this most sensitive and seductive work; and, above all, of Britain's attempt to use smoke and mirrors to mask decline.

It continues to do so today. Owing to the secrecy involved, however, such activity has consistently been excluded from debates about Britain’s global role, foreign and security policy and military planning: an important lacuna given the controversy, risk, appeal and frequency of covert action. Examining when, how and why covert action is used, this article argues that contemporary covert action has emerged from, and is shaped by, a specific context. First, a gap exists between Britain’s perceived global responsibilities and its actual capabilities; policy elites see covert action as able to resolve, or at least conceal, this. Second, intelligence agencies can shape events proactively, especially at the tactical level, while flexible preventative operations are deemed well suited to the range of fluid threats currently faced. Third, existing Whitehall machinery makes covert action viable. However, current covert action is smaller scale and less provocative today than in the early Cold War; it revolves around ‘disruption’ operations. Despite being absent from the accompanying debates, this role was recognised in the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review, which placed intelligence actors at the heart of British thinking.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FHJ5FWRQ,2017,Rory Cormac,,International Relations,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,['B6RJNLTK']

3355,Active Measures: The Secret History of Disinformation and Political Warfare,Book,,"This revelatory and dramatic history of disinformation traces the rise of secret organized deception operations from the interwar period to contemporary internet troll farms We live in the age of disinformation--of organized deception. Spy agencies pour vast resources into hacking, leaking, and forging data, often with the goal of weakening the very foundation of liberal democracy: trust in facts. Thomas Rid, a renowned expert on technology and national security, was one of the first to sound the alarm. More than four months before the 2016 election, he warned that Russian military intelligence was ""carefully planning and timing a high-stakes political campaign to disrupt the democratic process. But as crafty as such so-called active measures have become, they are not new. The story of modern disinformation begins with the post-Russian Revolution clash between communism and capitalism, which would come to define the Cold War. In Active Measures, Rid reveals startling intelligence and security secrets from materials written in more than ten languages across several nations, and from interviews with current and former operatives. He exposes the disturbing yet colorful history of professional, organized lying, revealing for the first time some of the century's most significant operations--many of them nearly beyond belief. A White Russian ploy backfires and brings down a New York police commissioner; a KGB-engineered, anti-Semitic hate campaign creeps back across the Iron Curtain; the CIA backs a fake publishing empire, run by a former Wehrmacht U-boat commander, that produces Germany's best jazz magazine. Rid tracks the rise of leaking, and shows how spies began to exploit emerging internet culture many years before WikiLeaks. Finally, he sheds new light on the 2016 election, especially the role of the infamous ""troll farm"" in St. Petersburg as well as a much more harmful attack that unfolded in the shadows. Active Measures takes the reader on a guided tour deep into a vast hall of mirrors old and new, pointing to a future of engineered polarization, more active and less measured--but also offering the tools to cut through the deception.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/3IWC79TZ,2020,Thomas Rid,Macmillan USA,,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,['B6RJNLTK']

Since the professionalization of intelligence services in the aftermath of the Second World War, this behaviour has become known as covert action, which—for generations of scholars—has been defined as plausibly deniable intervention in the affairs of others; the sponsor's hand is neither apparent nor acknowledged. We challenge this orthodoxy. By turning the spotlight away from covert action and onto plausible deniability itself, we argue that even in its supposed heyday, the concept was deeply problematic. Changes in technology and the media, combined with the rise of special forces and private military companies, give it even less credibility today. We live in an era of implausible deniability and ambiguous warfare. Paradoxically, this does not spell the end of covert action.

The Turkish Secret Service’s operations in Cyprus during its origins in the Cold War and the intra-alliance intelligence task have been largely overlooked in the existing literature.

The investigation of Turkey’s covert operations in Cyprus between 1953 and 1970 reveals the route of intra-alliance espionage in the Cyprus conflict and helps understanding how states act covertly against their allies.

The Egyptians used deception to neutralize two Israeli 'strong points' that might jeopardize the crossing of the Suez Canal: the capacity for a preemptive strike and deployment in strength in the Canal region. The deception aimed to minimize Israel's 'early warning space', delaying the moment of decision-making and slowing down the IDF's operational response. Implementing a dual technique of concealing and misleading, the deception lulled the Israeli early warning system, the linchpin of its security doctrine, into accepting the (wrong) alternative option.

In conducting deception, the deceiver has a clear advantage; empirical evidence confirms assumptions drawn from cognitive psychology that deception seldom fails when it exploits a target's preconceptions.

Cognitive biases in the assessment of probabilities, evaluation of evidence, and attribution of causality are described and related to questions of deception and counterdeception. Approaches to enhancing an organization's ability to detect deception are examined. Improved intelligence collection and heightened alertness to deception are often insufficient.

This spectrum of threats has led to an expansion of the stakeholders and tools involved in intelligence gathering and threat assessments. The article argues that to strengthen global health security and health intelligence, the traditional state-based intelligence community must actively engage with non-security stakeholders and incorporate space for new sources of intelligence.

This article explores issues around how states and non-state actors appropriate civilians’ images to produce intelligence about conflict, critically scrutinizing a practice often called open source or social media intelligence. It argues that image appropriation for open-source intelligence production creates a new kind of visual security paradox in which civilians can be endangered by their everyday visual practices because their digital images can be appropriated by outside actors as conflict intelligence. The transformation of everyday images into conflict evidence relies on what Barthes termed the photographic paradox, the paradox that while a photograph is clearly not the reality it depicts, the photograph is casually interpreted as a copy of that reality. When images are appropriated as conflict intelligence this photographic paradox translates into a security paradox. A visual security argument can be made without the intention or knowledge of the image producer, who then comes to perform the role on an intelligence agent. Yet civilians in warzones can hardly refrain from producing any images when they need to call attention to their plight, and to stay in contact with friends and relatives. The paradox, then, is that such vital visual signs of life can rapidly become sources of danger for the civilian. This civilian visual security paradox, it is argued, demands that intelligence actors respect the protected status of civilians in their online collection practices. So far, however, there is little sign of such respect.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ZMRPRFEN,"April 16, 2019",Rune Saugmann,,Intelligence and National Security,2020-12-25T08:54:33Z,['LXMU5UXP']

It does so by considering the impacts of OSINT on three important contemporary security issues: nuclear proliferation, humanitarian crises and terrorism. This edited volume takes a fresh look at the subject of open source intelligence (OSINT), exploring both the opportunities and the challenges that this emergent area offers at the beginning of the twenty-first century. In particular, it explores the new methodologies and approaches that technological advances have engendered, while at the same time considering the risks associated with the pervasive nature of the Internet. Drawing on a diverse range of experience and expertise, the book begins with a number of chapters devoted to exploring the uses and value of OSINT in a general sense, identifying patterns, trends and key areas of debate. The focus of the book then turns to the role and influence of OSINT in three key areas of international security - nuclear proliferation; humanitarian crises; and terrorism. The book offers a timely discussion on the merits and failings of OSINT and provides readers with an insight into the latest and most original research being conducted in this area., ""This new and fresh perspective on Open Source Intelligence should be a primary textbook in intelligence analysis, international security, and information science classes.

Especially neglected has been the fighting provoked by the German offensive in 1940 that cleaved through France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg and drove Britain off the Continent. This article tackles this gap, analysing the military intelligence/military operations interface on the French side. It assesses the contributions and shortcomings of radio-intercept intelligence, along with intelligence-gathering by air and ground reconnaissance (demonstrating that German air superiority imposed a ‘battle blindness’ on Allied commanders wanting intelligence on approach marches and formation switches more than a dozen kilometres into the German rear). It reveals that frontline infantry raiding – redolent of intelligence-gathering techniques familiar to veterans of 1914–18 trench warfare – was again widely employed. This proved a highly effective recourse, particularly during the positional battles on the Somme, Aisne and Oise in June 1940, filling intelligence gaps left by more technologically sophisticated but more fragile sources. The factors that kept formations fighting so as to inflict significant delays and heavy losses on the German assaults were robust communications networks (to convey operational intelligence fast enough to permit counter-manoeuvres based on it), and the preservation of French chains of command and control. When these key nodes collapsed, preventing the hard-won operational intelligence being deployed to coordinate French military resistance, the latter declined into a series of disjointed, directionless and unavailing acts of courage that could not exploit the several instances during the campaign when the Germans, too, were afflicted by battle fatigue, re-supply bottlenecks and morale wobbles.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/68UXI3PA,"June 1, 2013",Martin S.

One of the key findings is that Sigint became an essential source of intelligence information on both sides of the Iron curtain because of the failings of other intelligence sources, especially Human Intelligence (Humint). It is also apparent that Sigint, together with the reconnaissance satellites operated by the US and the USSR, consistently produced the most reliable intelligence available to consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.

This success occurred because the Canadian Corps developed a sophisticated and powerful system for set piece battles, in which intelligence played a key role. This article assesses how intelligence affected all aspects of this battle – from national and theatre level decision-making, down to the dissemination of information to individual soldiers.

In BODY OF SECRETS he offers shocking new details about the inner workings of the agency, gathered through unique access to thousands of internal documents and interviews with current and former officials. Unveiling extremely sensitive information for the first time, Bamford exposes the role the NSA played in numerous Soviet bloc Cold War conflicts and discusses its undercover involvement in the Vietnam War. His investigation into the NSA's technological advances during the last 15 years brings to light a network of global surveillance ranging from on-line listening posts to sophisticated intelligence-gathering satellites.

3495,"Strategic Warning: If Surprise is Inevitable, What Role for Analysis?",Document,http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA526588,"The dramatic events of 11 September 2001 color this paper, but it is not about the devastating terrorist attacks per se, nor about the daunting challenges of tactical warning. The focus, instead, is on strategic warning. Warning analysis is charged with applying all-source information, expert insights, and specialized tradecraft to help policy officials prevent or limit damage from threats to US security interests. Tactical warning, as defined in this paper, seeks to detect and deter specific threats to US interests; the objective is to avoid incident surprise and thus block or blunt damage. Strategic warning addresses perceived dangers in broader terms, in order to inform policymaker decisions on general security preparedness--again to prevent or limit damage. US national security resources are limited. Tactical warning cannot be counted on to pinpoint defensive measures by providing timely notice of all specific attacks and menacing developments. In this context, the challenge of strategic warning is to help policy officials decide--in advance of specific indicators of danger--which of the many plausible general threats to US security interests deserve concerted defensive and preemptive preparations. Strategic warning, to be effective, has to be credible in assessing contingent dangers and has to facilitate policymaker decision and action to protect against these dangers. This paper tables for consideration and debate several recommendations to advance two goals: (1) To reconstitute strategic warning as a collaborative governmental function by engaging policy officials responsible for effecting defensive measures in every step of the analysis process, including topic selection and trend monitoring; (2) To warrant a distinctive intelligence contribution to a collaborative warning effort by expanding dedicated analytic resources and sharpening requisite substantive expertise and specialized tradecraft.

3499,The Rational Timing of Surprise,Journal article,,"National leaders are frequently surprised by the actions of other governments. This paper explores the structure common to problems involving the use of resources for achieving surprise. Such resources include deception through double agents and through sudden changes in standard operating procedures. Still other resources for surprise include cracked codes, spies, and new weapons. Since surprise is usually possible only by risking the revelation of the means of surprise, in each case the same problem arises: when should the resource be risked and when should it be maintained for a potentially more important event later? A rational-actor model is developed to provide a prescriptive answer to this question. Examining the ways in which actual actors are likely to differ from rational actors leads to several important policy implications. One is that leaders may tend to be overconfident in their ability to predict the actions of their potential opponents just when the stakes get large. Another implication is that, as observational technology improves, the potential for surprise and deception may actually increase.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5S5SSKIP,1979,Robert Axelrod,,World Politics,2020-07-20T07:40:37Z,['9YPHGMBS']

Five cases of failures in intelligence estimates are discussed: (1) the Barbarossa Operation; (2) the attack on Pearl Harbor; (3) the Chinese Intervention in the Korean War; (4) the Sino-Indian Border War of October 1962; (5) the Arab-Israeli War of October 1973.

Perhaps this is due to the presumption that intelligence analysis influences decision-making as a precursor to and foundation for policy. This assumption about the influence of analysis on decision deserves a much closer examination. The 9/11 terrorist attacks provide a good case to study for greater understanding of the influence, or lack of influence, that intelligence analysis has on decision-making. Specifically, the 9/11 Commission Report identifies as a significant failure the lack of a National Intelligence Estimate on the terrorist threat between 1998 and 2001, and implies that if one had been produced it might have helped enable decision-makers to prevent the 9/11 attacks.

Analytic certainty is precluded by ambiguity of evidence, ambivalence of judgment, and atrophy of institutional reforms designed to avert failures. Many sources of error are unresolvable paradoxes and dilemmas rather than curable pathologies. Major failures in attack warning, operational evaluation, and intelligence for strategic planning are due primarily to leaders' psychological attributes rather than to analysts' failures to detect relevant data. Since analysis and decision are interactive rather than sequential processes, and authorities often hear but dismiss correct estimates, intelligence failure is inseparable from policy failure. Solutions most often proposed--worst-case analysis, multiple advocacy, devil's advocacy, organizational consolidation, sanctions and incentives for analysts, and cognitive rehabilitation--are either impractical because of constraints on the leaders' time, or they are mixed blessings because they create new problems in the course of solving old ones.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/65PQWP7F,1978,Richard K.

The assessments seem to have begun as a consequence of a debate within the administration over US Iraq policy in early 2001. The neoconservatives wanted intelligence that would help them argue for regime-change. A WINPAC 'Red Team' analyst analyzed the tubes using the same methodology as 1976's infamous Team B panel, which skewed intelligence to support neoconservative policies. The Red Team analyst erroneously concluded the tubes were for a nuclear program thus countering assessments that they had a non-nuclear purpose. After the attacks of September 11 and President Bush's embrace of regime-change, the Red Team tubes assessment began to become the official position of the Intelligence Community. In September 2002, the President cited the assessment publicly, forcing the Intelligence Community to adopt it as the majority position...",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/32B5QPI5,2012,Patrick Conway,,Intelligence and National Security,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,"['CZJ36V8L', 'D7XFV7JL']"

The JIB absorbed the responsibilities of several wartime intelligence organs, and was responsible for economic, topographic, and aspects of scientific intelligence on an inter-service basis. Its responsibilities grew over the following 18 years; most notably, it absorbed atomic intelligence in 1957. When the Defence Intelligence Staff was created in 1964, absorbing the JIB and the individual Service agencies, JIB was at its heart and Kenneth Strong its first Director. The organization conducted key work in the early Cold War, was at the centre of an international network of Joint Intelligence Bureaux, and was an important stepping stone in the movement to centralize military and military-relevant intelligence in Britain – but the historiography pays it surprisingly little attention.

Britain was determined to maintain this advantage following victory, but the wartime machinery was uneconomical, unwieldy, and unsuitable for peace. Drawing on oral testimony, international archives, and private papers, Defence Intelligence and the Cold War provides the first history of the hitherto little-known organisation designed to preserve and advance British capability in military and military-related intelligence for the Cold War: the Joint Intelligence Bureau (JIB).Headed by General Eisenhower's wartime intelligence man, Major General Kenneth Strong, the JIB was central to the mission to spy on and understand the Soviet Union, and the broader Communist world. It did so from its creation in 1946 to its end in 1964, when it formed a central component of the new Defence Intelligence Staff. This volume reveals hitherto hidden aspects of Britain's mission to map the Soviet Union for nuclear war, the struggle to understand and contain the economies of the USSR, China, and North Korea in peace and during the Korean War, and the urgent challenge to understand the nature and scale of the Soviet bomber and missile threat in the 1950s and 1960s. The JIB's dedicated work in these fields won it the support of some politicians and military men, but the enmity of others who saw the centralised organisation as a threat to traditional military intelligence. The intelligence officers of the JIB waged Cold War not only with Communist adversaries but also in Whitehall.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XDSWQFWV,2014,Huw Dylan,Oxford University Press,,2020-09-17T08:21:26Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE', 'CK5MNYPQ', '8F9EJ6CT']"

Based on a mass of newly declassified Russian secret intelligence documentation, it reveals the true story of Soviet intelligence from its very beginnings in 1917 right through to the end of the Cold War. Covering both main branches of Soviet espionage - civilian and military - Jonathan Haslam charts the full range of the Soviet intelligence effort and the story of its development:in cryptography, disinformation, special forces, and counter-intelligence.In a tragic irony, an organization that so casually disposed of others critically depended upon the human factor. Due to their lack of expertise and technological know-how, from early on the Soviets were forced to rely heavily on secret agents instead of the more sophisticated code-breaking techniques of other intelligence agencies. But in this they were highly successful, recruiting spy rings such as the infamous 'Cambridge Five' in the 1930s. Had it not been for Soviet espionage againstBritain's code-breaking effort during the Second World War, Stalin might never have won the victory that later enabled him to dominate half of Europe. Similarly, espionage directed at his allies enabled the Soviets to build an atomic bomb earlier than expected and to take calculated risks in post-wardiplomacy, such as his audacious blockade of Berlin which led to the Berlin Airlift.Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin in 1956 alienated many of the foreign 'friends' so valued by the Soviet intelligence services. It also made new recruitment of foreign agents much more difficult, as the USSR rapidly lost its glamour and ideological appeal to potential supporters in the West during the 1950s. However, the gap was finally bridged through exploiting greedy and disloyal Western intelligence officers, using blackmail and bribery - and with great success. In fact, it was theultimate irony that the KGB and GRU had never been more effective than when the Soviet Union began to collapse from within.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VMRCXNJF,2015,Jonathan Haslam,"Oxford University Press, Incorporated",,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,"['CZT6L9T7', '4BH8AYZE', 'CK5MNYPQ']"

The importance of this scheme is that it gives, through the Records of Progress and Conduct, a unique insight into the qualities that the first two heads of Britain's foreign intelligence service, and the first head of Britain's signals intelligence unit brought to their respective posts. This article argues that there are a number of timeless and vital competencies which cadets Smith, Sinclair and Hall displayed, albeit in embryonic form, that were critical, later on, in propelling their respective organizations to the centre of government.

Looking at the impact of shifts in the strategic environment, technological change, and past failures, he probes the reasons why Japan has endured such a roller-coaster ride when it comes to intelligence gathering and analysis, and concludes that the ups and downs of the past century—combined with growing uncertainties in the regional security environment—have convinced Japanese leaders of the critical importance of striking balance between power and insight. Using examples of excessive hubris and debilitating bureaucratic competition before the Asia-Pacific War, the unavoidable dependence on US assets and popular sensitivity to security issues after World War II, and the tardy adoption of image-processing and cyber technologies, Samuels' bold book highlights the century-long history of Japan's struggles to develop a fully functioning and effective intelligence capability, and makes clear that Japanese leaders have begun to reinvent their nation's intelligence community.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/NVUZFN5A,2019,Richard J.

3562,Arab / Islamic concept of intelligence in the case of Fatah paramilitary,Thesis,http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/3590,"This thesis provides a composite picture of the Islamic concept of intelligence traces the historical roots of Islamic intelligence activities and explains the (Ideological) relationship between the Islamic religion and the intelligence concept adhered to by modern Arab and Islamist paramilitary groups. Special reference is made to Fatah movement which has been taken up as a case study. The thesis shows that the two main sources of Islam (the Quran and the Sunnah) provided the regulative codes of practice towards intelligence activities. Prophet Muhammad’s intelligence tradition offers the ideal model that the Arab / Islamic paramilitary groups emulate. Referring to the Islamic roots, the research seeks to point out that the hallmarks of the Islamic intelligence concept which emerged from the Quran and Prophet Mohammed’s tradition, became the framework that accommodated ‘Arab / Islamic modern paramilitary intelligence activities’, such as Fatah’s. The thesis uses the modern concept of the intelligence to identify the ancient activities and compares data process within the intelligence cycle. The range of activities is broad: clandestine collection, counterintelligence, analysis and dissemination, and covert action. It also introduces the Arab intelligence tradecraft such as the uses of safe houses, methods of communication, secrecy and concealments...etc. This thesis also aims to correct the perception that Arab intelligence concept developed after the emergence and expansion of the Islamic Empire.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/V6TT2GHM,2009,Abdulaziz Abdullah Al-Asmari,,,2021-04-10T15:02:10Z,['CK5MNYPQ']

It did so on an inter-service, national level. The thesis examines the creation of the organisation, in the aftermath of the Second World War, exploring what factors and which people supported the creation of the new agency. It then moves on to examine the work of the JIB in several of its key fields of work, namely topography, economics and monitoring the threat from Soviet nuclear forces, before examining some of the JIB’s international connections and how these contributed to its work. It concludes with an examination of how the JIB begat the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS). It argues that the creation of the JIB was an appropriate response to the need to centralise and retrench in the intelligence machinery after the War, but that the organisation, in essence, represented a compromise between those who wanted to fully centralise military (and military-relevant) intelligence and those who wished to preserve service independence. Over the course of its existence it made important contributions to several key areas of policy – including mapping the Soviet Union for nuclear strike planning, the economic containment of the USSR, as well as China and North Korea during the Korean War, and in monitoring the production of Soviet bombers and missiles – before becoming a central component of the new DIS.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/29224HK5,2010,Huw Dylan,,,2021-02-10T15:42:08Z,['CK5MNYPQ']

It makes the case that the significance of understanding defence intelligence and DI lies not only in a general lack of illumination but also because DI is subject to and prompts a range of difficulties and challenges that are either especially acute in the defence context or have ramifications for the wider intelligence community that remain to be fully appreciated. Particular attention is given to DI’s remit being divided between Ministry of Defence and national requirements, problems of fixed-sum resourcing an intelligence function with national responsibilities that is subordinate to Departmental spending structures and priorities, fraught positioning of defence intelligence in Departmental line management and, finally, a chronic lack of public or official interest or scrutiny. The article concludes that the UK’s experience has echoes elsewhere, notably in the US, and that wider international study of defence intelligence is both long overdue and may have implications for understanding of national and wider intelligence institutions and processes.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/JKRT4Q9Z,"September 18, 2016",Philip H.

Decades of successive commissions identify the same or similar problems with the relationship and recommend organizational changes aimed at improving the analyst – policy maker interaction.

After briefly discussing the KGB precedent, I focus on the FSB annual art awards established in 2006. Although these awards include six categories and three prizes per each category plus honorable mentions, due to the length limitations, I focus only on the first prize winners of the literature award (awarded for fiction, nonfiction, and journalism). The key questions I investigate are, first, what kinds of literary works the FSB deems worthy of the first prize and, secondly, what the FSB literary taste conveys about the self-image that it has sought to construct for domestic and international audiences as well as about its strategic orientation. I conclude that the FSB has a predilection for spy fiction based on real historical events and personalities. Some of the first prize winners are biographies and reference books, but the majority can be categorized as historical fiction. Not surprisingly, they depict self-confident and patriotic intelligence officers who ultimately, though not without a lot of effort, overcome the assorted villains: the tsarist officers, the criminal gangs, the corrupt officials and turncoats in contemporary Russia and, last but not least, the CIA operatives. Curiously, though they generally deal with the threat from the West, many FSB-awarded historical novels are set in the Russian Central Asian or Far Eastern regions.

Intelligence studies as an academic discipline is not very theoretical compared to the more established disciplines of political science and international relations. In terms of conceptual depth, levels of abstraction and theoretical development, even the theoretical portions of the academic intelligence studies literature could be described as policy relevant and potentially useful for practitioners, including intelligence analysts. Yet despite this orientation to the practitioner, there is still a substantial gap between scholars and practitioners, thus replicating within a more applied context the conventional theory/practice divide that exists in other fields. Those fields do, however, possess a variety of ideas and recommendations that could be used to bring scholarship on intelligence analysis closer to practice.

The purpose of this approach to intelligence pedagogy is to get participants to think through and work out analytic methods, issues, and potential solutions from first principles and for themselves. Our strategy is to try and fuse training and education learning outcomes, so that students emerge with a technical competence in analytic methods, underpinned by a deeper understanding of the foundations and internal logic shaping those methods. The Iraq Matrix exercise seeks to unpack and examine the nuts and bolts of source evaluation, and to test alternative hypotheses with particular attention to the relationship between the quality of various sources and, the weight of judgements they can or cannot sustain. The ultimate goal is to encourage what is currently fashionably referred to as ‘reflexive practice’, whereby the practitioner reflects critically and self-critically upon how their task works and how they do it, then uses those insights to improve their workplace performance. But not all of our teaching is directed towards practitioners. For those whose aims are scholarly and academic, the aim is to give observers a more visceral understanding of the challenges of the intelligence task they intended to study.

Just as it is important for policymakers and citizens to understand the limits to what intelligence can deliver, so it is important to recognize the limits to what social science methods can offer intelligence analysis. Moreover, it is at least equally important to recognise crucial differences in the environments in which mainstream social science research and national security intelligence analysis are conducted. A clear understanding of these is essential to thinking about the utility of social science approaches to intelligence analysis.

Although both goals are achievable, no one knows how close the current generation of SATs comes to achieving either of them. We identify two root problems: (1) SATs treat bipolar biases as unipolar. As a result, we lack metrics for gauging possible over-shooting—and have no way of knowing when SATs that focus on suppressing one bias (e.g., over-confidence) are triggering the opposing bias (e.g., under-confidence); (2) SATs tacitly assume that problem decomposition (e.g., breaking reasoning into rows and columns of matrices corresponding to hypotheses and evidence) is a sound means of reducing noise in assessments. But no one has ever actually tested whether decomposition is adding or subtracting noise from the analytic process—and there are good reasons for suspecting that decomposition will, on balance, degrade the reliability of analytic judgment.

3646,Red Team: how to succeed by thinking like the enemy,Book,,"Red teaming. It is a practice as old as the Devil s Advocate, the eleventh-century Vatican official charged with discrediting candidates for sainthood. Today, red teams comprised primarily of fearless skeptics and those assuming the role of saboteurs who seek to better understand the interests, intentions, and capabilities of institutions or potential competitors are used widely in both the public and private sector. Red teaming, including simulations, vulnerability probes, and alternative analyses, helps institutions in competitive environments to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses, challenge assumptions, and anticipate potential threats ahead of the next special operations raid, malicious cyberattack, or corporate merger. But not all red teams are created equal; indeed, some cause more damage than they prevent. In Red Team, national security expert Micah Zenko provides an in-depth investigation into the work of red teams, revealing the best practices, most common pitfalls, and most effective applications of these modern-day Devil s Advocates. The best practices of red teaming can be applied to the CIA, NYPD, or a pharmaceutical company, and executed correctly they can yield impressive results: red teams give businesses an edge over their competition, poke holes in vital intelligence estimates, and troubleshoot dangerous military missions long before boots are on the ground. But red teams are only as good as leaders allow them to be, and Zenko shows not only how to create and empower red teams, but also what to do with the information they produce. Essential reading for business leaders and policymakers alike, Red Team will revolutionize the way organizations think about, exploit, compensate for, and correct their institutional strengths and weaknesses.

3652,Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis,Book,,"This book takes the relatively new concept of structured analytic techniques, defines its place in a taxonomy of analytic methods, and moves it a giant leap forward. It describes 50 techniques that are divided into eight categories. There are techniques for: Decomposition and Visualization Idea Generation Scenarios and Indicators Hypothesis Generation and Testing Cause and Effect Challenge Analysis Conflict Management Decision Support Each structured technique involves a step-by-step process that externalizes an individual analyst s thinking in a manner that makes it readily apparent to others, thereby enabling it to be shared, built on, and easily critiqued by others. This structured and transparent process combined with the intuitive input of subject matter experts is expected to reduce the risk of analytic error. Our current high tech, global environment increasingly requires collaboration between analysts with different areas of expertise and analysts representing different organizational perspectives. Structured analytic techniques are the ideal process for guiding the interaction of analysts within a small team or group. Each step in a technique prompts relevant discussion within the team, and such discussion generates and evaluates substantially more divergent information and more new ideas than a team that does not use a structured process. By defining the domain of structured analytic techniques, providing a manual for using and teaching these techniques, and outlining procedures for evaluating and validating these techniques, this book lays a common ground for continuing improvement of how analysis is done. These techniques are especially needed in the field of intelligence analysis where analysts typically deal with incomplete, ambiguous and sometimes deceptive information.

3657,Is Politicization Ever a Good Thing?,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/02684527.2012.749065,"Politicization is the manipulation of intelligence estimates to reflect policy preferences. Policymakers are guilty of politicization if they compel intelligence agencies to alter their conclusions in ways that are politically convenient or psychologically comforting. Intelligence officials are guilty of politicization if they shape their estimates to reflect their own beliefs and preferences. At first glance politicization appears to be an unalloyed hazard: manipulating estimates seems to make bad intelligence inevitable. Nonetheless, some observers argue that under certain circumstances politicization can be a good thing, or at least a necessary risk. Intelligence officials should be willing to take that risk if the alternative means isolating themselves from the policy process and sacrificing any possible influence over policymakers' judgment. They also should be willing to tone down their conclusions on major issues, or withhold estimates on minor ones, in order to avoid offending policymakers.

Some forms of politicization are clearly unethical, but politicization is not inherently evil. In fact it is an ethically neutral form of rhetorical discourse which when properly controlled can provide policymakers with additional decision advantage. When viewed through a rhetorical lens, evidence-based purposeful politicization is more objective than inadvertent influence because it does not try to hide where the evidence leads. By decoupling objectivity and neutrality, it becomes clear that taking a stand on the evidence or making a tough recommendation based on professional judgment are not practices that need to be avoided. As intelligence practitioners seek to remain relevant in the 21st century, embracing ethically-controlled, evidence-based, policy prescriptive analysis can give them the tools they need to succeed.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/C5STFIJH,"February 1, 2013",Nathan Woodard,,Intelligence and National Security,2021-01-21T10:00:34Z,"['HCN8YFI8', 'B4CCZ7Y8']"

First, an ideal intelligence program would take a ‘Goldilocks’ approach, neither relegating intelligence to the fringes (as academia has done in the past) nor elevating it to a degree program (as is the approach at dozens of US colleges and universities). Because US intelligence agencies prefer their candidates for employment to have substantive knowledge of global issues and language skills, a certificate or minor program in intelligence will educate students about intelligence without depriving them of the opportunity to major in a substantive field. Second, an ideal program will involve former professional intelligence officers to a high degree; too many academic programs in intelligence suffer from the metaphorical ‘Bulgaria problem’ in which alleged experts on Bulgaria don’t speak the language, have never been to Bulgaria, and don’t see their lack of experience on Bulgaria as a problem.

Other books have been nearly perfect for such students. Since Villanova University is a few hours from Washington, D.C., students have rarely encountered anyone who actually works in intelligence.

Under the constraints of a foreign policy that sought to gradually encourage the government of Sweden to become more pro-allied rather than pro-axis and ‘non-belligerent’, SOE nonetheless entered Sweden with hopes of developing a series of contacts with groups and individuals that could be turned into active resistance if Sweden joined the axis, or if Nazi Germany either invaded or occupied Sweden and the whole of Scandinavia. Once the possibility of an axis invasion of Sweden was decisively dismissed, SOE had to find a different role. In Sweden, the successful development of SOE's intelligence gathering capabilities in the economic sphere, especially in the allied campaign against German iron-ore traffic and ball-bearings, provided the organization with a purpose that definitely took another course when compared to intelligence activities in other regions and countries.

Strategic surprise was obtained because the idea that Germany was about to launch a major invasion of Norway was remote from any of the preconceived scenarios about Germany's next move. Germany's achievement of tactical surprise was also aided by bad weather in the North Sea. The main reason for the failure of both Norwegian and British policy-makers to comprehend what the Germans were up to lies in the importance of the ‘mindset’. On both sides of the North Sea the conventional wisdom was that Germany would not attempt an invasion of Norway against the supremacy of British sea power. Hence all incoming information was interpreted in Oslo in the light of the next mindset, namely that only a determined British attempt to take control of the Norwegian coast could trigger an armed German retaliation. In London, incoming intelligence was interpreted so as to conform to the Admiralty's preconceived scenario of a German naval breakout into the North Atlantic.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FRGBL9Y5,"August 1, 2007",Olav Riste,,Intelligence and National Security,2021-05-21T21:55:17Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

MI5 was one of three bodies responsible for the administration of Defence Regulation 18b (DR18b) and as such its power was limited by an inherent system of checks and balances. As others have suggested, the administration of DR18b was full of tension; however, it is now apparent that this tension was a positive feature of the defence regulations and one that protected the individual rather than condemned him. The strategic detention of key figures from Britain's fascist circles effectively destroyed the ability of fascists to function in unified organizations.

Britain struggled against a global terrorist campaign which attacked British targets in Palestine, Egypt and the wider Middle East, continental Europe and the United Kingdom. This article refutes claims by other authors that British rule in Palestine failed because of intelligence failure. Intelligence failure was limited, but so were successes. British intelligence produced reasonable assessments on Zionist politics, but could do little to prevent violence without the cooperation of the Jewish Agency. Success was driven by a combination of signals intelligence, secret agents, one key defector, interrogations and intelligence shared by the Jewish Agency. Failure resulted from a weak understanding of the Zionist underground and from lack of cooperation by Agency authorities. Normally Britain's junior partner, the Jewish Agency was, by 1945, struggling against British restrictions on Jewish immigration and settlement in Palestine. Its militia, Haganah, turned to cooperation with terrorists. British intelligence predicted that such developments could occur, but failed to identify them as they unfolded. Britain's dependence on Zionist security intelligence was a key vulnerability that never was addressed by policy-makers. The Jewish Agency leveraged its cooperation, applying it to prevent terrorism in Egypt and the United Kingdom, where violent incidents would harm the Zionist cause. It had little reason to prevent terrorism in the key battlegrounds of Palestine or Europe, and so terrorism harmed Britain's will to continue fighting. The root cause of Britain's failure was at the policy level. Despite known weaknesses, government never assessed its own will and ability to uphold restrictions on Zionist immigration, or to fight terrorism, as against the Yishuv's will and ability to struggle against Britain.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BPFD68KV,"May 27, 2014",Steven Wagner,,The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History,2021-05-14T07:49:02Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'MP7FJ9UA', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

It evolved into a truly ‘joint’ unit but culturally was closer to the Security Service (MI5) than either the military or the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). SIME changed dramatically as a result of the end of the Second World War: it became the sole responsibility of MI5; local cooperation between MI5 and MI6 was scaled-down and became the focal point of a broader inter-intelligence service dispute in London; and new nationalist threats caught SIME off-balance and eventually undermined its raison d'être. SIME's contrasting wartime and peacetime iterations provide a useful example of how intelligence agencies respond to external pressures.

In response, the Allied Powers did not hesitate to intervene diplomatically or militarily. Therefore, the main objective of this article is to reveal the most fundamental components of Operation Warden, a British sabotage plan designed in 1941 which, although not ultimately implemented, stipulated the sinking of several German and Italians vessels in Puerto de la Luz (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria).",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/RC8LTUQU,"February 23, 2020",Marta García Cabrera,,Intelligence and National Security,2020-12-21T10:14:47Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"
3717,Control not morality? Explaining the selective employment of Nazi war criminals by British and American intelligence agencies in occupied Germany,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/02684527.2019.1705101,"This article reveals for the first time why a Nazi war criminal named Günter Ebeling who was employed by the American Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) in occupied Germany was violently killed by British intelligence officers. Through analysis of hitherto unpublished Intelligence Division documents, it argues that existing debates concerning the post-war employment of Nazi war criminals in occupied Germany have been framed in the wrong light. Discussions concerning security and control, not morality, usually surrounded disputes regarding the employment of Nazis. Close and comparative analysis of Ebeling’s recruitment and ‘dismissal’ with that of several other Nazis demonstrates that hindsight, source limitations and a prevalent case study approach have prevented the identification of common reasoning concerning security and control which surrounded the post-war employment of war criminals in several areas of intelligence work. Indeed, new evidence suggests that the British and American intelligence services employed some Nazi war criminals in post-war Germany as part of a wider strategy of control designed to ensure the security of the occupation and pave the way for a future democratic Germany. Through the analytical prism of security and control, this article provides a synthesis between a multitude of case studies.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/R67LZ54E,"April 15, 2020",Luke Daly-Groves,,Intelligence and National Security,2020-12-20T10:01:30Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

Recently opened archives show that the British response to Soviet claims in 1945 was driven by comprehensive access to Turkish diplomatic correspondence. However, the British failed to recognize wartime decrypts that indicated continuity in Soviet ambitions in Turkey since 1940.

R. D. Foot, leading to the publication of SOE in France in 1966. The work has traditionally been viewed as the official response to critical investigative works on SOE published during the 1950s, combined with the vocal campaign of Dame Irene Ward, who made several calls in the House of Commons for an official account of SOE to be published. Material now available at the Public Record Office reveals that these were not the sole considerations in official minds, nor the most significant, concerning the possibility of publishing such a work. The foreign office was particularly concerned that Britain's contribution to wartime resistance in Europe, exemplified by SOE, was being overshadowed by both soviet propoganda, emphasizing the communist contribution to resistance, and the publicity being given to SOE's American counterpart, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). The ‘campaign’ of Dame Irene Ward, supported by the negative slant given to SOE in the books of Jean Overton Fuller and Elizabeth Nicholas, unknowingly gave support to a frame of mind that was already in existence in favour of an unofficial account of SOE activity, albeit for different reasons.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/L2SDIN3F,2003/12,Christopher J.

In the course of his research, Robin Denniston has uncovered previously unknown files of diplomatic intercepts which show that Churchill's role in British foreign policy and war planning was far more signficant than has hitherto been supposed. Although neither a commander-in-chief nor a head of state, he personally exerted considerable influence on British foreign policy to force Turkey into the Second World War on the side of the Allies. This ground-breaking book explores Churchill's use of secret signals intelligence before and during the Second World War and also sheds fresh light on Britain's relations with Turkey - a subject which has not received the attention it deserves. The book examines a little-known plan to open a second front in the Balkans, from Turkey across the eastern Mediterranean, designed to hasten D-Day in the west, and reveals new information on the 1943 Cicero spy scandal - the biggest Foreign Office security lapse until the Burgess and Maclean affair some twenty years later.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/ULTWV2UI,2016-08-04,Robin Denniston,The History Press,,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'SCCGXHMZ']"

In this riveting new account, Daniel Larsen tells the full story for the first time of how Asquith and his supporters secretly sought to end the war. He shows how they supported President Woodrow Wilson's efforts to convene a peace conference and how British intelligence, clandestinely breaking American codes, aimed to sabotage these peace efforts and aided Asquith's rivals. With Britain reading and decrypting all US diplomatic telegrams between Europe and Washington, these decrypts were used in a battle between the Treasury, which was terrified of looming financial catastrophe, and Lloyd George and the generals.

They miss the fact that the British first considered using gas in the region during the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. At that time, the political and military leadership in London, as well as senior commanders of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (MEF), were alarmed by the possibility of Turkish chemical attacks and repeatedly debated whether they should pre-empt this move by initiating the use of gas. This raised ethical, moral and prestige considerations, related to the British reputation in the Middle East. Eventually, gas cylinders were shipped to the MEF but never used.

Further, the resulting scale of unfiltered data such a system would produce might serve to overwhelm rather than assist decision-makers.

Intelligence as a process and product has been strongly promoted by the EU as a useful and necessary tool in the fight against terrorism, radicalization, organized crime and public order problems. A range of agencies has been established that collect, analyze and operationalize intelligence in view of strategically defined security threats. Examples are Europol and Frontex. This article makes an inventory of their roles and competences in the field of intelligence and looks at the list of instruments that encourage the sharing of intelligence between different law enforcement and security agencies. Moreover, it is argued in this article that as intelligence becomes more hybrid and as the EU only holds light powers of oversight on ownership and integrity of data, considerable governance challenges lurk around the corner.

After 9/11 there was a shift from the study of inter-state intelligence to the use of intelligence against non-state actors such as Al Qaeda.

It argues that there are two main reasons why they may be unable to effectively contain foreign fighter mobilizations. The first is the challenge of inter-state intelligence cooperation due to conflicts of interests between countries. Linked to this are problems in how intelligence is shared. The second reason is the tension, at the domestic level, between collection and prosecution concerns in the investigation of foreign fighter networks. Countering foreign fighting is not the same as countering terrorism, and sometimes the two objectives are in opposition to one another. The article concludes by calling for more research on how states counter foreign fighter mobilizations, particularly focusing on the activities of intelligence, security and police agencies. Counter-mobilization is an important intervening variable that shapes the scale and nature of foreign fighter mobilizations to a greater extent than hitherto reflected in the literature.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/S7ZQFDTT,20/12/2016,Timothy Holman,,Perspectives on Terrorism,2020-07-17T19:37:48Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'TLFN4NAL']"

For similar reasons, its Cold War institutions enshrined distinctions between foreign and domestic, and public and private. The CIA was and is, for instance, enjoined from law enforcement and domestic activity. Those distinctions served the country tolerably well during the Cold War but set it up to fail on September 11. Now, a rethinking of them is underway, as the balance between security and liberty is re-struck. It is imperative, though, to learn the right lessons on September 11. That means thinking carefully and proceeding slowly as changes are made.

The acrimonious public arguments over subjects such as Iraqi WMD assessments, secret prisons and the interrogation of detainees suggest intense transatlantic discord. Yet improbably, some of those countries that have expressed strident disagreement in public are privately the closest intelligence partners. It is argued here that we can explain this seeming paradox by viewing intelligence co-operation as a rather specialist kind of ‘low politics’ that is focused on practical arrangements. Intelligence is also a fissiparous activity, allowing countries to work together in one area even while they disagree about something else. Meanwhile, the pressing need to deal with a range of increasingly elusive transnational opponents—including organised crime—compels intelligence agencies to work more closely together, despite their instinctive dislike of multilateral sharing.

In particular, the important role of signals intelligence, liaison relationships, document exploitation, and interrogation are overlooked. In addition, intelligence analysis and the relationship with the policymaker differ fundamentally for counterterrorism.

The offer of talks may lead terrorists' constituents to reduce their support for violence, and moderates within a group itself may also turn away from violence. Despite these potential benefits, even the consideration of entering discussions carries many risks. Talks with U.S. officials do indeed reward the use of terrorism, tangibly demonstrating that groups can kill innocents and yet become legitimate interlocutors-a reward that is costly both in terms of reducing the prevalence of this tactic worldwide and because it inevitably angers local allies fighting the groups. Moreover, talks often fail in a variety of ways, giving the terrorists a breathing space to rearm and organize and leaving the government looking foolish.

3810,Statecraft by Stealth: Secret Intelligence and British Rule in Palestine,Book,,"Britain relied upon secret intelligence operations to rule Mandatory Palestine. Statecraft by Stealth sheds light on a time in history when the murky triad of intelligence, policy, and security supported colonial governance. It emphasizes the role of the Anglo-Zionist partnership, which began during World War I and ended in 1939, when Britain imposed severe limits on Jewish immigration and settlement in Palestine. Steven Wagner argues that although the British devoted considerable attention to intelligence gathering and analysis, they never managed to solve the basic contradiction of their rule: a dual commitment to democratic self-government and to the Jewish national home through immigration and settlement. As he deftly shows, Britain's experiment in Palestine shed all pretense of civic order during the Palestinian revolt of 1936–41, when the police authority collapsed and was replaced by a security state, created by army staff intelligence. That shift, Wagner concludes, was rooted in Britain's desire to foster closer ties with Saudi Arabia just before the start of World War II, and thus ended its support of Zionist policy. Statecraft by Stealth takes us behind the scenes of British rule, illuminating the success of the Zionist movement and the failure of the Palestinians to achieve independence. Wagner focuses on four key issues to stake his claim: an examination of the ""intelligence state"" (per Martin Thomas's classic, Empires of Intelligence), the Arab revolt, the role of the Mufti of Jerusalem, and the origins and consequences of Britain's decision to end its support of Zionism.Wagner crafts a superb story of espionage and clandestine policy-making, showing how the British pitted individual communities against each other at particular times, and why.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/WFSW2TRY,2019,Steven B.

As a result, in 1945–46, the three Jewish armed groups in the Mandate, the Haganah, Etzel and Lehi, started a loosely coordinated armed struggle against British rule. Even the moderates in the Jewish Agency rejected their former partner against Hitler, Britain, and used force against it in order to achieve their political goals. This article assesses British intelligence on these developments, and demonstrates that it failed to anticipate or even to understand the threat until the destruction of the King David Hotel. The article demonstrates that these mistakes occurred because British intelligence relied heavily on the intelligence organs of the Jewish Agency itself for intelligence about political threats within Palestine.

Intelligence was fundamental to the security of the country, since it varyingly augmented understrength force, or supported overwhelming force. Intelligence also supported policymakers as issues of governance were debated. It allowed British decision makers to avoid making a decision on self-government during the 1920s and it supported Britain’s failed attempts to introduce a constitution during the 1930s. Intelligence also was crucial to Britain’s relations with the Arab nationalist and Zionist communities. Of particular importance was Britain’s partnership and subsequent war with the Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini. This thesis sheds new light on the role of intelligence in British colonial policymaking, the development of the Arab-Zionist conflict, and how Britain failed to manage communal violence.</p> <p>This research offers a new and improved explanation of the origins, unfolding, and defeat of the Palestinian Arab rebellion. British intelligence and policymakers failed to grasp the sophistication of the Palestinian national movement until the mid-1930s, and even then, they focused on clan competition and the politics of ‘notables’. Intelligence and military records explain how British police and military struggled, but ultimately succeeded to suppress and defeat this rebellion. Victory was made possible by innovations within the intelligence and planning staffs, as well as Zionist cooperation.</p> <p>Intelligence shaped policy most clearly at the beginning and end of the period under examination. During 1918-20, the military government was administered by intelligence officers who guaranteed Britain’s future control in Palestine both domestically, and at the League of Nations. In 1939, British policy abandoned its traditional Zionist partners when the need to impose a solution on Palestine coincided with the opportunity, revealed by signals intelligence, to bolster and leverage the influence of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz ibn Sa’ud over the Arab national movement.</p>",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9JN72L3C,2014,Steven Wagner,,,2021-05-14T07:43:29Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'MP7FJ9UA']"

Holocaust survivors and Jews wishing to escape communism in Eastern Europe flooded the western Zones of occupation in Germany and Austria, while the Zionist movement worked to bring them to Palestine. Illegal immigration to Palestine was the key policy dispute between Britain and the Zionist movement, and a focus for British intelligence. Britain sought both overt and covert means to prevent the boarding of ships at European ports which were destined for Palestine, and even to prevent the entry of Jewish refugees into the American zones. This article highlights Britain's secret intelligence-gathering efforts as well as its covert action aimed to prevent this movement. It highlights a peculiar episode in the ‘special relationship’ between Britain and the United States, during which cooperation and partnership was lacking. British intelligence promoted a rumour that Soviet agents were using Jewish escape lines to penetrate Western Europe and the Middle East in order to persuade American authorities to prevent the movement of Jewish refugees. Instead, this article argues, American intelligence secretly cooperated with the Zionist organizers of the escape routes so to expose Soviet agents. Britain's attempt at deception backfired, and provided effective cover for the movement of hundreds of thousands of Jews during a critical period. Meanwhile its intelligence had dramatically improved, but policymakers failed to reassess Britain's ability to sustain immigration restrictions and the indefinite detention of tens of thousands of illegal migrants.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/XS9G8VQU,"September 3, 2014",Steven Wagner,,Intelligence and National Security,2021-01-17T23:36:21Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'MP7FJ9UA']"

This article will challenge this judgement by examining the activities, impact and consequences of a British civil servant, Alfred Cope, who between 1920 and 1921 was an Assistant Under Secretary in Dublin Castle. Using the three criteria of counter-intelligence operations: the ability to locate, identify and neutralize a target, it will be shown that within months of his posting to Dublin British intelligence, albeit inadvertently, had located and identified him as passing classified information to Sinn Fein. Political patronage meant the ability of the intelligence community to neutralize his impact was nugatory.

Historians have struggled to define clearly Eden’s resistance. The intelligence archive allows for a reassessment of British policy towards Italy and Eden’s resignation.

3817,The Great Terror: A Reassessment,Book,,"The definitive work on Stalin's purges, Robert Conquest's The Great Terror was universally acclaimed when it first appeared in 1968. Edmund Wilson hailed it as ""the only scrupulous, non-partisan, and adequate book on the subject."" George F. Kennan, writing in The New York Times Book Review, noted that ""one comes away filled with a sense of the relevance and immediacy of old questions."" And Harrison Salisbury called it ""brilliant...not only an odyssey of madness, tragedy, and sadism, but a work of scholarship and literary craftsmanship."" And in recent years it has received equally high praise in the Soviet Union, where it is now consideredthe authority on the period, and has been serialized in Neva, one of their leading periodicals.Of course, when Conquest wrote the original volume two decades ago, he relied heavily on unofficial sources. Now, with the advent of glasnost, an avalanche of new material is available, and Conquest has mined this enormous cache to write a substantially new edition of his classic work. It is remarkable how many of Conquest's most disturbing conclusions have born up under the light of fresh evidence. But Conquest has added enormously to the detail, including hitherto secret information on the three great ""Moscow Trials,"" on the fate of the executed generals, on the methods of obtaining confessions, on the purge of writers and other members of the intelligentsia, on life in the labor camps, and many other key matters.Both a leading Sovietologist and a highly respected poet, Conquest here blends profound research with evocative prose, providing not only an authoritative account of Stalin's purges, but also a compelling and eloquent chronicle of one of this century's most tragic events. A timely revision of a book long out of print, this updated version of Conquest's classic work will interest both readers of the earlier volume and an entirely new generation of readers for whom it has not been readily available.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BQ2DZL3V,1990,Robert Conquest,Oxford University Press,,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,"['4BH8AYZE', 'MP7FJ9UA']"

3819,The Anatomy of Terror: Political Violence under Stalin,Book,,"Stalin's Terror of the 1930s has long been a popular subject for historians. However, while for decades, historians were locked in a narrow debate about the degree of central control over the terror process, recent archival research is underpinning new, innovative approaches and opening new perspectives. Historians have begun to explore the roots of the Terror in the heritage of war and mass repression in the late Imperial and early Soviet periods; in the regime's focus not just on former ""oppositionists,"" wreckers and saboteurs, but also on crime and social disorder; and in the common European concern to identify and isolate ""undesirable"" elements. Recent studies have examined in much greater depth and detail the precipitants and triggers that turned a determination to protect the Revolution into a ferocious mass repression.The Anatomy of Terror is an edited volume which brings together the work of the leading historians in the field, presenting not only the latest developments in the subject, but also the latest evolution of the debate. The sixteen chapters are divided into eight themes, with some themes reflecting the diversity of sources, methodologies and angles of approach, others showing stark differences of opinion.

war and warfare. They are held as critically important to the successful pursuit of policy and
war and they are also held as critically important to each other; strategy functions better with
positive intellgence support, and intelligence cannot function at all without the direction of
strategy. Despite this obvious importance however, the relationship between strategy and
intelligence remains under-explored, as neither Strategic Studies nor lntelligence Studies
have sought to codify that relationship. lnstead those two sub-fields have been subject to
""drivers"" that have propelled the forward focus of those areas, drivers which have been
focused on the empirical demand of the day. This thesis seeks to explore this gap and
identify, codify, and operationalise the relationship between strategy and intelligence, before
testing this model against a single case study, British performance during the 1956 Suez
crisis, in order to observe the real world working and reveal broader insight into the
relationship in practice.
The relationship will be shown to be an inherently political activity that is also extremely
dynamic as well as covering entire governmental machineries. That relationship is not perfect
however, and the roles played by assumptions are a consideration of particular importance
that carry significant consequences in reality. That reality in the fonn of the British
experience during the 1956 Suez Crisis serves to reveal that although there is a model to
explain and perhaps even imply a harmonious functioning of the relationship, the reality
instead shows significant impediments to the smooth functioning of this relationship. By
creating this model and then testing it against the real world practice of strategy and
intelligence, it is intended to reveal that strategy and intelligence share a special but very
fragile relationship in practice.

The article ventures to separate the apologetics and (flawed) memories from the information provided by the now available documentary evidence. After presenting the prevailing Israeli version, the article analyses the memoirs on the Egyptian side about the preparations for war and determining D-Day, to refute this version. Based on the contemporary protocols of government and general staff meetings and political-military consultations, it argues that the Israeli government, general staff and intelligence community did not regard at the time the outbreak of war as an imminent threat. The steps they took concerned the medium and long run, and were irrelevant in the short run. Similarly, the mobilization of reserves was not connected to the alarm of war but to the Day of Independence parade in Jerusalem. The article claims on the basis of these protocols that the reason for the excitement was the collapse of the Israeli intelligence’s conception that Egypt would not resume hostilities before it could hit at the interior of Israel, and Syria would not go to war without Egypt. The arrival of Libyan Mirages and Iraqi Hunters to Egypt in April fulfilled this condition and the possibility of war could not be dismissed offhand. Israel responded to the new situation by the book. It shared the information and analysis with the White House and the CIA; it refreshed the IDF planning down to the divisional level and the IDF general staff held a series of thorough discussions to estimate the situation. The bottom line of this process was a government directive to the IDF to prepare for war at the end of the summer of 1973 (as it actually happened). In the latter portion of the article I explain why this directive was ignored when it was put to test in late September and early October of 1973.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/5BEI343X,"August 1, 2013",Yoav Gelber,,Intelligence and National Security,2021-01-21T09:47:12Z,['DHLN8GE4']
3842,Military Intelligence and Controversial Political Issues: The Unique Case of the Israeli Military Intelligence,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/02684527.2012.748370,"Contrary to intelligence services in other democracies worldwide, the activity of the Israeli Directorate of Military Intelligence, AMAN, is not merely centered around collection and research regarding military intelligence matters. Instead, AMAN covers the majority of intelligence activity arenas, including intelligence regarding state-related issues. This field of activity presents a situation where AMAN's officers, and predominantly, its research division, are compelled to deal with sensitive issues embedded well within Israeli political and public controversy. This is commonly illustrated in the field of ‘Intelligence for Peace’ in general and more specifically in the Palestinian arena. Intelligence research surrounding the question of Palestinian commitment to peace throughout the Oslo Process and following the onset of the al Aqsa Intifada – activity classified as ‘Intelligence on Intentions’ – placed AMAM at the heart of political debate in Israel and resulted in bitter internal disagreements in AMAN as well as tensions between the intelligence service and the political leadership. Throughout the years, numerous recommendations have been repeatedly voiced to end AMAN's monopoly over Israel's national intelligence assessment (including aspects of intelligence regarding state-related issues). These recommendations were based predominantly on hindsight evaluations, such as AMAN's repeated failures in intelligence assessments. This paper calls for gradual termination of AMAN's activity of intelligence regarding state-related issues, in light of its contradiction with the appropriate military–political separation in a democratic society. Moreover, it places AMAN at the heart of the political debate dividing Israeli society.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/62UQD757,"March 4, 2014",Eyal Pascovich,,Intelligence and National Security,2021-01-17T23:37:54Z,['DHLN8GE4']

To date, historians have not found proof of his accusations in British archives. However, evidence may be found in French archives, especially in Syrian and secret British documents obtained by the French secret services, originating from agents who had infiltrated the Syrian government in Damascus and the British Legation in Beirut. This article, based on French, Syrian, Israeli and British sources, argues that under the Labour government, Arabist MI6 officers in the Middle East, in collaboration with the British High Command in Cairo, pursued an alternative policy to that of the Foreign Office. They provoked Egypt’s King Faruq to go to war against Israel without the knowledge or approval of either Prime Minister Clement Attlee or Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, frequently misinforming and misleading them.

This article examines the contemporaneous estimates of British intelligence on the Soviet ballistic missile program, which were based upon very similar, if not the same, raw intelligence. It demonstrates that British estimates of the Soviet ICBM program were more accurate. However, this success did not continue in the analysis of the medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missile (M/IRBM) threat, which was relatively poor for most of the period.

This article re-examines US intelligence estimates of the Soviet Union prior to the Cuban Missile Crisis in light of the concept of ‘mirroring risk’, introduced in this article.

The thesis shows that our understanding of the Cold War as a binary rivalry between the two blocs is too simple an approach and obscures important characteristics of intelligence cooperation among allies. To reveal a more comprehensive analysis of intelligence cooperation, this thesis develops our understanding of it more broadly, by developing a model called ‘intelligence diplomacy’. This model explores a vital, if little understood, aspect of contemporary international relations given the prevalence of transnational threats today. Intelligence diplomacy involves negotiations and the exploitation of different aspects of joint intelligence activities, synchronized between diplomats and specialized intelligence officers. While such efforts often result in overlap between diplomats and intelligence liaison efforts, there is strong evidence that the acts of intelligence services vary from the instructions of their foreign ministries. The thesis also shows that a pragmatic approach offers states new opportunities to protect national interests, by conducting intelligence diplomacy to influence crucial areas such as nuclear weapons and to exploit cooperation in support of their own strategic imperatives. By doing so this thesis not only reveals previously-unexplored origins of secret intelligence cooperation between Turkey and the West, but also contributes to wider academic debates on the nature of the Cold War by highlighting the potential agency of weaker states in the Western Alliance.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Q8TGVRAX,2017,Egemen B.

President Ronald Reagan, however, on the advice of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, listened to Gordievsky rather than his intelligence advisors.

In the absence of a complete archival record, given that important documents were shredded, the full truth about the fact and nature of any Czechoslovak assistance may never be known. Yet there are some grounds for speculation that assistance was granted by elements within the Czechoslovak secret services, and that these elements failed to inform the Communist Party leadership about their actions.

It will be argued that the successes or failures of each of these men in command were directly linked to their understanding of the importance of gathering and using intelligence in the field. For Wolseley and Wood, their ability to lead men to victory in battle, operate in harsh environments and adapt their operations with the intelligence they received resulted in the 1870s being a springboard for future fame and glory.

As a result, in the wake of the conflict, Russia set out to reorganize her whole intelligence structure via deep and broad-ranging reform, initiating developments that would ultimately culminate in the Soviet Union becoming one of the premier‘panoptic’ surveillance states of the twentieth century in terms of the measures it took to guard against both internal and external ‘hidden forces’.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/S8763KDD,"October 1, 2007",Alex Marshall,,Intelligence and National Security,2021-05-21T21:54:08Z,"['9DTPTK46', '4BH8AYZE']"

Marder established what became the orthodox view of the development of the British navy in the years leading up to the First World War.1 Building upon the work of Sir Llewellyn Woodward, who argues that, from the outset of the twentieth century, British naval policy was framed as a response to the threat posed by the rising German naval power,2 Marder makes precise claims about the nature of the response. In particular, he states that, under the leadership of the first sea lord from 1904 to 1910, Admiral Sir John Fisher, the admiralty undertook two root-and-branch reforms. First, it redeployed Britain's fleets and squadrons, reducing the number of foreign stations, scrapping obsolescent vessels, and stationing the most powerful units of the fleet in European waters. Next, at Fisher's prompting, it triggered a naval revolution by ordering the building of a new type of warship, HMS Dreadnought, the world's first turbine-powered, all-big-gun battleship. In both cases, Marder is unambiguous about the motive: the redeployment adjusted Britain's force posture to ensure a preponderance of strength in the vicinity of the North Sea, the theatre in which the expected war with Germany would be fought. The new type of ship was necessary to help to modernize the navy's matériel in keeping with advances in gunnery, propulsion, and torpedoes. If not explicitly aimed at Germany, the new ship would ensure that the navy was better prepared for a war that Fisher perceived to be ‘inevitable’s.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/D6JSYJVX,"June 1, 2008",Matthew S.

Fortifications figured prominently in armaments budgets and in offensive as well as defensive strategic planning, while their design changed radically. Nonetheless, the pattern of development worked against the Central Powers.

They involved surmounting difficulties of terrain and climate, frequently over immense distances that were often more formidable than the challenges posed by enemy forces. Commanding officers usually embarked on campaigns with clear strategic aims (often directed at high-value targets, like an enemy's capital city) and an operational purpose (of bringing the enemy to battle as soon as possible), but needed intelligence to plot routes and prepare tactically for military engagements. In reviewing the lessons from two very different campaigns – the reconquest of the Sudan (1896–99) and the South African War (1899–1902) – there were striking differences in the quality of the intelligence gathered, the way in which it was used, and in the overall contribution of intelligence to the success of the respective campaigns.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/G5U2Z4YI,"October 1, 2007",Edward M.

Italian civil society also increasingly recognizes the importance of intelligence. This paper first explores Italian intelligence studies literature as it stands today before considering the academic research. The six main categories of Italian intelligence literature are presented within: history, sources of intelligence, international relations and geopolitics, theories of intelligence and theoretical frameworks, great figures and memoirs, law enforcement, and the fight against criminal organizations. A short comparative analysis between the Italian literature and international intelligence studies is drawn which includes a comparison of categories, topics, key questions, and projects. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to draw a likely depiction of the state of Italian intelligence studies.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BF4YYVI2,"November 7, 2021","Mario Caligiuri, Giangiuseppe Pili",,"The International Journal of Intelligence, Security, and Public Affairs",2021-11-10T00:06:39Z,['AZ3BZ9BR']

The Cold War, however, turned terrorism into a global televised drama personified by “the Bin Laden of the Cold War” and “enemy number one”- Carlos the Jackal. Who was this tall man in a black beret, thick glasses, and a smirk on his face? How was the Carlos myth created, was he really that prolific and ‘successful’ and how do you get rid of such a hothead, politely? In this episode we look at why the US was sure the East was runninga worldwide terrorism network and we explore whether all Eastern bloc countries were best friends with Carlos the Jackal. 
This is a story of guns, kidnappings and murders but also a story of a small Eastern bloc country pulling a daring trick on the Cold War’s most feared terrorist.

Research infrastructure has been created with journals and conferences. The article explores how a European School of Intelligence Studies (ESIS) differs from the traditional British and American research and which scholars constitute ESIS. This work also presents new methodical proposals (e.g. using a quantitative method for selecting material from the existing empirical data sets), following the requirement that intelligence studies should have an interdisciplinary nature. Our argumentation is based on an analysis of the two main conferences, the conference of the International Intelligence History Association (IIHA) and the Need to Know-format (NtK), and it defines the content of the ESIS based on state of the art. European researchers participating in these fora were primary from Germany, Benelux, the Nordic states, and Central- and Eastern Europe. ESIS shows European West-East unity and strong ties to British, American and Israeli research, it also indicates a North-South divide. The Archival Revolution has been defining for the development of the ESIS. The access to documents regarding all areas of intelligence activity, including operational records and personal files of agents, differs from traditional declassification. This way, it is possible in Europe to do empirical research on intelligence operations in a hitherto unseen scale. Furthermore, the ESIS is characterized by substantial interest to counterintelligence and awareness of the differences between intelligence in democracies and authoritarian regimes.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YGE9BL3X,"September 1, 2020","Władysław Bułhak, Thomas Wegener Friis",,"The International Journal of Intelligence, Security, and Public Affairs",2021-05-27T06:31:17Z,['HCN8YFI8']

At a time of acute political crisis, the partisan interests of the legislators who sit on oversight bodies may override their other responsibilities. This can result in distorted and misleading investigations and reports. This hypothesis is examined against the evidence of precisely such a mode of failure in both the British and American legislative inquiries into intelligence on Iraqi ‘weapons of mass destruction’. The authors conclude that any effective oversight must include a range of parallel legislative, judicial, executive and independent mechanisms to try and minimize the inherent weaknesses in each oversight model.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/HSES4KGA,"October 1, 2006","Anthony Glees, Philip H.

Academics and the public at large therefore to this very day face great difficulties in answering two specific questions: What covert action has the CIA carried out in Europe during its almost 60 years of existence? Did CIA covert action violate human rights in Europe? Some operations, however, have become known and are now in the public research domain. Among them are the clandestine anti-communist stay-behind networks set up by the CIA in case of a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. As the details of the operation emerge only gradually some sources suggest that the stay-behind network was linked to terrorist groups, adding further interest to this largely unknown research subject at a time when the so called ‘war on terrorism’ has forced academics to examine present and historical terrorism data once again.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FNAA93SF,"October 1, 2006",Daniele Ganser,,Intelligence and National Security,2021-05-23T17:51:49Z,['DVEM4H4W']

It argues that Ludlum and the makers of the film version of The Bourne Identity incorporated a variety of aspects of reality into their plotlines. Some of these aspects are not entirely factual, while others stick very closely to the truth. Congressional oversight, ethical dilemmas tied to assassination and real-life antagonists play significant roles in both the novel and the film. In the book the antagonists are terrorists, particularly Carlos the Jackal, but in the movie version the ‘bad people’ are CIA officials. Although the antagonist changes between the novel and the film, they both are realistic aspects that draw the audience in. Not only do these three aspects of reality contribute to the plots of the novel and the film, but they also make the audience reflect on issues brought up in the film.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/VP7HA7K2,"February 1, 2008",Shannon Mollie Epps,,Intelligence and National Security,2021-05-21T21:52:08Z,['9YH9YSYQ']

Drawing from a letter written to the first writer who ever used a spy as a central character, indeed, a hero, this paper suggests that such a transformation is made easier when, among other things, well-meaning people present obstacles to the spy's work – people who meddle in the business of spying. The paper concludes, after a survey of several contemporary writers, that they have done so by turning Congress into the meddler.

3938,The truth of espionage is stranger than fiction,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/02684520701798122,"Using two 2007 films – Breach and Lives of Others– the author furthers the argument he has made elsewhere that, indeed, truth is stranger than fiction as far as movies about espionage are concerned. Robert P. Hanssen, the FBI agent who spied first for the Soviet Union and then for Russia for more than two decades, defies logic. His outward persona contradicted his real self more than one can imagine. In Lives of Others, the paper submits that the reality of the totalitarian existence in East Germany was also almost impossible to imagine. But both of these films do a creditable job in trying to make the unimaginable seem possible. Moreover, the paper argues that the famous ‘outing’ of CIA undercover officer, Valerie Plame, has all of the material for good cinema, but that the failure to prosecute those who violated the law by revealing her true position is what is unimaginable in that case.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/QG9QW9U4,"February 1, 2008",Frederick P.

3939,Intelligence in fiction,Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/02684520701798106,"In this literary lecture, presented in Ottawa at a 2006 conference on intelligence sponsored by the Canadian Association for Security and Intelligence Studies (CASIS), spy novelist Charles McCarry ruminates on his profession as a writer. He reflects back on how his work has been influenced by his first career as an officer in the Central Intelligence Agency during the 1950s. After leaving the CIA, he wrote about his experiences in the world of espionage (sans anything classified) while operating in deep cover and engaging in covert action in, as he recalls, ‘some of the world's most godforsaken places’. The key to good spy fiction, in McCarry's view, is to write ‘the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth’.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/WQ4DQWDZ,"February 1, 2008",Charles McCarry,,Intelligence and National Security,2021-05-21T21:51:36Z,['9YH9YSYQ']
3940,"Hollywood, don't you go disrespectin' my culture: The Good Shepherd versus real CIA history",Journal article,https://doi.org/10.1080/02684520701798080,"Filmography and literature alike are full of examples of ‘getting the history right’ either through a semi-documentary approach, like the film Tora Tora Tora, or through fictional works that nonetheless are true to the historical times they represent. Robert DeNiro's recent film, The Good Shepherd, fails on both counts while purporting to be ‘the untold story’ of the CIA's early years. This article argues that there is no need for Hollywood to concoct fiction about intelligence and call it history, because the real stories should be compelling enough. One of the great true stories from this period is the saga of John Downey and Richard Fecteau, CIA officers captured in China in 1952 and held for two decades. But because the reality of their riveting experience does not square with Hollywood's agenda about the CIA and intelligence, it is doubtful that an accurate movie about them will ever make the silver screen.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/GW6XGWCZ,"February 1, 2008",Nicholas Dujmovic,,Intelligence and National Security,2021-05-21T21:51:30Z,['9YH9YSYQ']

They both star Robert Redford and both portray the Central Intelligence Agency as a wicked organization. In light of Hollywood's distorted depiction of the CIA in these movies, their contribution to the health and well-being of the American polity – which depends, like all democracies, on the presence of an informed citizenry – is questionable. As with the best written scholarship on the subject of intelligence, film-goers deserve to know accurately not only what is bad but what is good within the shadows of America's dark side of government, and how the bad might be redressed. The United States needs to try harder to bring the best form of art to the spy movie: cinematography that seeks to tell the truth.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/TAQWYDXX,"February 1, 2008",Loch K.

Some have taken the approach of ‘ostriches’, content to bury their heads in the sand and continue the earlier era of trust when members of Congress deferred to the decisions of the executive branch within the domains of intelligence. Others – indeed, a majority – have chosen to become unalloyed boosters for intelligence –‘ cheerleaders’ who view their job primarily as one of explaining the value of intelligence to the American people and supporting intelligence missions with robust funding and encouragement. Taking the opposite approach, another set of lawmakers – the ‘lemon-suckers’ – have consistently found fault with America's attempts to spy on adversaries or overthrow regimes that fail to accommodate US interests. Finally, some lawmakers have been ‘guardians’, striking a balance between serving as partners of the intelligence agencies on Capitol Hill and, through a persistent examination of budgets and operations, demanding competence and law-abiding behavior from these agencies. The guardian model fits best into the framework of democratic theory.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/MBJMNFKD,"April 1, 2008",Loch K.

The literature largely presents intelligence ethics as a two-sided debate between teleologists and deontologists. I propose that ethical justifications should instead be considered along a progressive spectrum drawn from the work of moral psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg. Such a spectrum has numerous applications for gauging the moral arguments of individual practitioners of intelligence. I illustrate this using the dilemma of targeted political assassination – first in a hypothetical context, and finally using examples from the investigations of the 1975 Church Committee.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/WELTTW43,"February 1, 2011",Allison M.

Intelligence is often focused on threats, missing opportunities for advantage. A standard definition is proposed for better understanding of intelligence by the academy, media and public. Intelligence is a corporate capability to forecast change in time to do something about it. The capability involves foresight and insight, and is intended to identify impending change which may be positive, representing opportunity, or negative, representing threat.

Once the work of an insular and carefully select few, intelligence production is now a networked, partially open and extensively public–private enterprise. Most poignantly, new practices of public–private ‘collection’ face Western intelligence services with novel questions about control and accountability – questions to which the services have responded with hopes that by standardizing ‘methodologies’, central command may be retained. Suggesting a more complex picture, this article argues that ‘managing uncertainty’ imply forms of interpretation and choices which cannot be pre-empted by rule-regulation: more than Weber’s ideal of the procedural and rule-bound, it may be his (once central, yet largely marginalized) emphasis on institutional and individual capacities for critical ‘judgment’ that is of relevance today.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/9VZQUJEQ,"January 2, 2018","Karen Lund Petersen, Vibeke Schou Tjalve",,Intelligence and National Security,2020-12-29T07:25:39Z,['DVEM4H4W']

We argue that Bond is important because, rightly or wrongly, and not without inaccuracy, it has filled a public knowledge vacuum about intelligence agencies and security threats. On another level, this article explores the unexpected yet important interactions between Bond and the actual world of intelligence. We contend that the orthodoxy dictating that Bond and spying are diametric opposites—one is the stuff of fantasy, the other is reality—is problematic, for the worlds of Bond and real intelligence collide, overlap and intermesh in fascinating and significant ways. In short, Bond is important for scholars because he is an international cultural icon that continues to operate at the borders of fiction and reality, framing and constructing not only public perceptions but also to some degree intelligence practices. Core narratives of intelligence among not only the public but also policymakers and intelligence officers are imagined, sustained, deepened, produced and reproduced through and by Bond. We conclude that Bond and intelligence should be thought of as co-constitutive; the series shapes representations and perceptions of intelligence, but it also performs a productive role, influencing the behaviours of intelligence agencies themselves.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/WJ242IFJ,"September 19, 2018","Trevor McCrisken, Christopher Moran",,Intelligence and National Security,2020-12-29T07:02:21Z,['9YH9YSYQ']

Considers that post-September 11, the Western perception of intelligence gathering may have changed - from something involving states in competition with each other, to a cooperative enterprise for shared objectives. As a result, intelligence budgets have recovered after the post-Cold War peace dividend and were anyway being restored to deal with humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.

Both professions are in the business of information acquisition. Spies, though, work for the government, while the allegiance of most scholars is to independent research and teaching. Moreover, spy organizations view students as potential hires; in contrast, scholars are likely to see students as young charges placed in their hands to educate and prepare for lives of consequence. One school of thought argues that, since spies and scholars are both citizens, they should work together in partnership: sharing knowledge to improve the intelligence product, training and recruiting students, warning of radical activities on campus. A second school counters that the university is meant to be a pure and open place, dedicated to unbiased learning and free of government ties – especially entanglements with secret agencies.

On the one hand, public exposure is not compatible with effectiveness & if that effectiveness is deemed more important than transparency society pays a high price with respect to understanding the role that covert intelligence plays in providing public security. On the other hand, if transparency is valued over effectiveness then society pays a high price in loss of security effectiveness. The author argues public support & understanding is necessary in order for society to value the work of intelligence agencies, particularly in terms of their efforts to combat terrorism. That said society must also demonstrate confidence in intelligence agencies that they will adhere to generally accepted principles of conduct such as proportionality & right authority. C.

4054,Beyond the vigilant state: globalisation and intelligence,Journal article,,"Abstract The world of intelligence has grown exponentially over the last decade. This article suggests that prevailing explanation of this expansion – the spectre of ‘new terrorism’ – reflects serious misunderstandings. Much of the emergency legislation which has extended the power of the state so remarkably was already sitting in the pending trays of officials in the late 1990s. Instead, the rise of both the ‘new terrorism’ and its supposed nemesis – the secret state – both owe more to long-term structural factors. Globalisation has accelerated a wide range of sub-military transnational threats, of which the ‘new terrorism’ is but one example. Meanwhile the long-promised engines of global governance are nowhere in sight. In their absence, the underside of a globalising world is increasingly policed by ‘vigilant states’ that resort to a mixture of military power and intelligence power in an attempt to address these problems. Yet the intelligence services cannot meet the improbable demands for omniscience made by governments, nor can they square their new enforcer role with vocal demands by global civil society for improved ethical practice.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/NT6G8JYJ,2009,Richard J.

4114,Spy Watching: Intelligence Accountability in the United States,Book,,"All democracies have had to contend with the challenge of tolerating hidden spy services within otherwise relatively transparent governments. Democracies pride themselves on privacy and liberty, but intelligence organizations have secret budgets, gather information surreptitiously around the world, and plan covert action against foreign regimes. Sometimes, they have even targeted the very citizens they were established to protect, as with the COINTELPRO operations in the 1960s and 1970s, carried out by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against civil rights and antiwar activists. In this sense, democracy and intelligence have always been a poor match. Yet Americans live in an uncertain and threatening world filled with nuclear warheads, chemical and biological weapons, and terrorists intent on destruction. Without an intelligence apparatus scanning the globe to alert the United States to these threats, the planet would be an even more perilous place.  In Spy Watching, Loch K. Johnson explores the United States' travails in its efforts to maintain effective accountability over its spy services. Johnson explores the work of the famous Church Committee, a Senate panel that investigated America's espionage organizations in 1975 and established new protocol for supervising the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the nation's other sixteen secret services. Johnson explores why partisanship has crept into once-neutral intelligence operations, the effect of the 9/11 attacks on the expansion of spying, and the controversies related to CIA rendition and torture programs. He also discusses both the Edward Snowden case and the ongoing investigations into the Russian hack of the 2016 US election. Above all, Spy Watching seeks to find a sensible balance between the twin imperatives in a democracy of liberty and security. Johnson draws on scores of interviews with Directors of Central Intelligence and others in America's secret agencies, making this a uniquely authoritative account.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BN9FKPQ4,2018,Loch K.

Indeed, while some secrecy is needed for mission success, too much has allowed significant abuse. Moreover, extending this secrecy to democratic oversight actors only creates another layer of unobserved actors and removes the public scrutiny that keeps their power and decision-making in check. This article will therefore argue for a new type of oversight through a specialised ethical whistleblowing framework. This includes, first, outlining what intelligence wrongdoings justify whistleblowing; second, whether whistleblowing is the correct remedy – something not necessarily clear with intelligence; and finally, what form the whistleblowing should take. This framework will examine the Snowden case to determine whether he was correct leaking intelligence data and whether the means were appropriate, and second, whether those involved...",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/YCUZ9AAT,2018,Ross W.

Proponents of enhanced interrogation laud the speed and efficacy of particular forms of torture, especially in critical ticking bomb scenarios. Torture critics, on the other hand, propose that detainees subjected to painful interrogation are likely to provide spurious confessions in order to escape their predicament; that erroneous information extracted during torture sessions will overwhelm intelligence agencies with false leads; and that nonviolent interrogation methods produce superior results.

Recently, they have been bolstered by allegations of prisoner abuse that some have linked to intelligence organisations. Such demands for judgement are articulated with equal measures of urgency and apprehension: there is a perceived need to make clear statements about what constitutes morally prohibited and permissible conduct with regard to intelligence gathering, and yet the tools with which one might perform such a task are not readily apparent. This article begins with three basic assumptions. First, intelligence collection does not exist in an amoral realm of necessity, but, rather, is a human endeavour involving choice and deliberation and, therefore, is vulnerable to ethical scrutiny.

Only nine parliamentarians - the members of the Intelligence and Security Committee - have the continuing legal authority to pry into the most sensitive activities of MI6, MI5 and GCHQ and report back candidly to the Prime Minister on how well the country's intelligence Agencies are performing. Since the Committee was set up in 1994 it has also made sanitised copies of its reports available to Parliament and the public which - when the space between the lines is read by experts - can reveal a great deal. But how well has the Committee done its job? The Open Side of Secrecy is the first in-depth analysis of the Intelligence and Security Committee's first ten years.

The concept of the intelligence cycle has been central to the study of intelligence. As Intelligence Studies has established itself as a distinctive branch of Political Science, it has generated its own foundational literature, within which the intelligence cycle has constituted a vital thread - one running through all social-science approaches to the study of intelligence and constituting a staple of professional training courses. However, there is a growing acceptance that the concept neither accurately reflects the intelligence process nor accommodates important elements of it, such as covert action, counter-intelligence and oversight. Bringing together key authors in the field, the book considers these questions across a number of contexts: in relation to intelligence as a general concept, military intelligence, corporate/private sector intelligence and policing and criminal intelligence. A number of the contributions also go beyond discussion of the limitations of the cycle concept to propose alternative conceptualisations of the intelligence process. What emerges is a plurality of approaches that seek to advance the debate and, as a consequence, Intelligence Studies itself. This book will be of great interest to students of intelligence studies, strategic studies, criminology and policing, security studies and IR in general, as well as to practitioners in the field.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/Y25L9DVK,2013,Mark Phythian,Taylor and Francis,,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,['HCN8YFI8']

4125,Introduction to Intelligence Studies,Book,,"Since the attacks of 9/11, the United States Intelligence Community (IC) has undergone an extensive overhaul. Perhaps the greatest of these changes has been the formation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. As a cabinet-level official, the Director oversees the various agencies of the IC and reports directly to the President. The IC today faces challenges as it never has before; everything from terrorism to pandemics to economic stability has now become an intelligence issue. As a result, the IC is shifting its focus to a world in which tech-savvy domestic and international terrorists, transnational criminal organizations, failing states, and economic instability are now a way of life.  Introduction to Intelligence Studies provides a comprehensive overview of intelligence and security issues, defining critical terms, and reviewing the history of intelligence as practiced in the United States. Designed in a practical sequence, the book begins with the basics of intelligence, progresses through its history, describes best practices, and explores the way the IC looks and operates today. Each chapter begins with objectives and key terms and closes with questions to test reader assimilation.  The authors examine the ""pillars"" of the American intelligence system―collection, analysis, counterintelligence, and covert operations―and demonstrate how these work together to provide ""decision advantage."" The book provides equal treatment to the functions of the intelligence world―balancing coverage on intelligence collection, counterintelligence, information management, critical thinking, and decision-making. It also covers such vital issues as laws and ethics, writing and briefing for the IC, and the emerging threats and challenges that intelligence professionals will face in the future.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/FPVB2HT2,2012,"Carl J.

4126,Some Concepts that may be Useful in Understanding the Myriad Forms and Contexts of Surveillance,Journal article,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0268452042000302976,"In Strategic Interaction, Erving Goffman demonstrated how the activities of intelligence agencies could be related to other social settings of information control. Intelligence gathering can be viewed as a general process whether involving national security, business intelligence, consumer behaviour or families. Goffman suggests concepts applicable across a variety of settings, although his primary concern is with face-to-face interaction. Recent developments in surveillance and communication also give the study of remote interaction increased salience. There is need for concepts that include the distance-mediated forms of observation and interaction associated with new technological forms such as video and computer surveillance. I seek an empirical, analytic and moral ecology (or geography or mapping) of surveillance. Of particular interest are data which are involuntarily collected and recorded from individuals, whether through intrusive and invasive methods (prying out what is normally withheld) or using technology to give meaning to what the individual offers (for example, appearance, emissions unrecognised by the unaided senses, or behaviour which traditionally was ignored and unrecorded). As part of a broader inquiry, I analyse five aspects of surveillance as empirical and behavioural phenomena: the characteristics of the means themselves; the content or the kind of data gathered; the structures of the setting in which the surveillance is used; the application of the means and the goals sought. The paper emphasises the first two. Identifying such factors are an initial step in setting research agendas and in explanation, evaluation and the creation of policies sensitive to the richness of the empirical world.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/L5RJDBMY,2004,Gary Marx,,Intelligence and National Security,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,['HCN8YFI8']
4127,"Intelligence, International Relations and 'Under-theorisation'",Journal article,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0268452042000302949,"This article submits that the conceptual framework within which intelligence is studied must continue to evolve and adapt to the new conditions of the early twenty-first century. As more intelligence and intelligence related material than ever before enters the public domain, scholars of international relations must take greater account study of the role of intelligence. Despite its obvious importance to the course of the Cold War, for example, most accounts of the Cold War tend to ignore or downplay the importance of signals intelligence in particular. Intelligence, moreover, is all but absent in most contemporary international relations theory. The essay argues that intelligence should be placed closer to the centre of new interpretations of both the course of the Cold War and of the political dynamics of authoritarian states.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/8IIGX66Y,2004,Christopher Andrew,,Intelligence and National Security,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,['HCN8YFI8']
4128,Classified: Secrecy and the State in Modern Britain,Book,http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/kcl/detail.action?docID=1113039,"Classified is a fascinating account of the British state's long obsession with secrecy and the ways it sought to prevent information about its secret activities from entering the public domain. Drawing on recently declassified documents, unpublished correspondence and exclusive interviews with key officials and journalists, Christopher Moran pays particular attention to the ways that the press and memoirs have been managed by politicians and spies. He argues that, by the 1960s, governments had become so concerned with their inability to keep secrets that they increasingly sought to offset damaging leaks with their own micro-managed publications. The book reveals new insights into seminal episodes in British post-war history, including the Suez crisis, the D-Notice Affair and the treachery of the Cambridge spies, identifying a new era of offensive information management, and putting the contemporary battle between secret-keepers, electronic media and digital whistle-blowers into long-term perspective.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/IQXESL6Y,2012,Christopher Moran,Cambridge University Press,,2020-07-12T12:36:38Z,"['HCN8YFI8', 'DVEM4H4W']"

4131,Wanted: A Definition of Intelligence,Journal article,https://apps.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA525816,"In a business as old as recorded history, one would expect to find a sophisticated understanding of just what that business is, what it does, and how it works. If the business is intelligence, however, we search in vain. As historian Walter Laqueur warned us, so far no one has succeeded in crafting a theory of intelligence. I have to wonder if the difficult) in doing so resides more in the slipperiness of the tools than in the poor skills of the craftsmen or the complexity of the topic. Indeed, even today, we have no accepted definition of intelligence. The term is defined anew by each author who addresses it, and these definitions rarely refer to one another or build off what has been written before. Without a clear idea of what intelligence is, how can we develop a theory to explain how it works? If you cannot define a term of art, then you need to rethink something. In some way you are not getting to the heart of the matter. Here is an opportunity: a compelling definition of intelligence might help us to devise a theory of intelligence and increase our understanding. In the hope of advancing discussions of this topic, I have collected some of the concise definitions of intelligence that I deem to be distinguished either by their source or by their clarity. After explaining what they do and do not tell us, I shall offer up my own sacrificial definition to the tender mercies of future critics.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BRT2X4Z9,2002,Michael Warner,,Studies in Intelligence,2020-06-12T13:06:25Z,['HCN8YFI8']
4132,Intelligence in an Insecure World,Book,http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/kcl/detail.action?docID=1367686,"Over a decade on from the terrorist attacks of 9/11, intelligence continues to be of central importance to the contemporary world. Today there is a growing awareness of the importance of intelligence, and an increasing investment in it, as individuals, groups, organizations and states all seek timely and actionable information in order to increase their sense of security. But what exactly is intelligence? Who seeks to develop it and how? What happens to intelligence once it is produced, and what dilemmas does this generate? How can liberal democracies seek to mitigate problems of intelligence, and what do we mean by ""intelligence failure?""' In a fully revised and expanded new edition of their classic guide to the field, Peter Gill and Mark Phythian explore these and other questions. Together they set out a comprehensive framework for the study of intelligence, discussing how 'intelligence' can best be understood, how it is collected, analysed, disseminated and acted upon, how it raises ethical problems, and how and why it fails. Drawing on a range of contemporary examples, Intelligence in an Insecure World is an authoritative and accessible guide to a rapidly expanding area of enquiry - one which everyone has an interest in understanding.",https://www.zotero.org/groups/intelligence_bibliography/items/BMV3JJKQ,2012,"Peter Gill, Mark Phythian",Polity Press,,2020-06-12T13:06:25Z,['HCN8YFI8']
